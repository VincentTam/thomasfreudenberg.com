Yesterday I upgraded my site to [Community Server 2.1 RTM](http://communityserver.org/blogs/announcements/archive/2006/08/09/Community-Server-2.1-Now-Available.aspx). I'm astonished how many additional mods I'm already using:

[Community Server MVP's Alabaster CSModule Package](http://www.csmvps.com/blogs/news/archive/2006/08/14/Community-Server-MVP_2700_s-Alabaster-CSModule-Package.aspx)   
A collection of CSModules written by CS MVPs and myself. (I contributed the Akismet spam rule btw)

[Qgyen.AllCommentRss](http://qgyen.net/archive/2006/08/04/Qgyen.AllCommentRss-for-CS-v2.1-RC1.aspx)  
Provides a secure RSS feed for all comments within a certain blog. It also provides information like if it is an actual comment or a trackback, the post's name, URL, if it is approved, and then it gives quick links to approve/disapprove, view, or delete the comment.

[Qgyen.Lightbox](http://qgyen.net/archive/2006/08/09/Improved-Lightbox2-JS-for-Community-Server.aspx)  
A Lightbox module for any photo from the gallery, an URL or [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/).

[Improved version](http://qgyen.net/archive/2006/08/09/Scott_2700_s-Flickr-for-Community-Server-_2800_Updated_2900_.aspx) of [Scott's Flickr for Community Server](http://scottwater.com/blog/archive/2006/07/20/Flickr-For-Community-Server.aspx)   
Add a Flickr area to the content selector, which enables you to select images from your Flickr account.

[Qgyen.ExtendedUrlMapping](http://qgyen.net/archive/2006/07/14/Qgyen.ExtendedUrlMapping-for-CS-v2.1.aspx)   
This module allows you to easily map one URL within Community Server to another. I for instance use it to map both my blog and my gallery to the root.

Syntax Highlighting module  
Formats code snippets with syntax highlighting. I cannot give you any link, because I'm using a modified version of a CS1.1 module, and I don't know the original author anymore.

[CommunityServer OpenSearch Handler](http://www.robertmclaws.com/archive/2006/08/04/New-CommunityServer-OpenSearch-Handler-Posted.aspx)  
Adds OpenSearch support to your blog, allowing IE7 users to search your site from their toolbar without any installation.

[CoComment support](http://nayyeri.net/archive/2006/07/21/Adding-CoComment-support-to-Community-Server-2.1.aspx)  
Tracks your comments across the blogosphere.

I just noticed that three and a half modules of the modules are written by [Ken Robertson](http://qgyen.net/). Seems as he is the most active guy on the Community Server community. [;)]
