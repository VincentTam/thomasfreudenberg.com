...is now called [Windows PowerShell](http://blogs.msdn.com/powershell/) and available as [RC1](http://blogs.msdn.com/powershell/archive/2006/04/25/583344.aspx).

[Heath Stewart](http://blogs.msdn.com/heaths) says in his comment:

> I find this tedious. Typing "cmd" is so much better than "command" as we had to in Windows 9x, just as "msh" is so much better than typing "powershell". The more generalized "Microsoft Shell" sounds prominant, like "korn shell" and "bash shell". "PowerShell" just sounds like too much of a buzzword, and buzzwords don't tend to last.

I agree on him. I guess I'll continue saying Monad as I'm still saying Avalon, Indigo,... well, you name it.

BTW, did the marketing folks at Microsoft try [Google](http://www.google.com/search?q=powershell) before picking PowerShell?
