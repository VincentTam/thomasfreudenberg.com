I just want to announce that I added [Snap Preview](http://www.snap.com/about/spa1.php "Snap Preview") to my blog. But unlike [Scott](http://scottwater.com/blog/archive/snappreview-images.aspx "SnapPreview Images") and [J-O](http://joeriksson.com/archive/2006/11/19/improving-the-community-server-blog.aspx "Improving the Community Server Blog"), I enabled them only for external links. IMHO it is useless for internal links.
