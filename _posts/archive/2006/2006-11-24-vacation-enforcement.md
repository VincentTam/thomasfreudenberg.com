Because of a mayor release in our company and the obligatory deadline pressure, I have a backlog of 30.5 free days, i.e. there's even half a day left from 2005. Because our boss decreed that we can transfer only a maximum of 10 free days to the next year, this means that I have to take more than 4 weeks off until the end of this year.

Therefore I'm taking a three week vacation starting today. Because I *desperately* need some relaxation, I'll fly to Mexico on Sunday. Yes, only two days until take-off. [:)]

Because the trip takes only two weeks, maybe in my third vacation week I have some time to post all the stuff that's already waiting in my queue for month. But I'm afraid that I'll need several days to read all new posts  from the blogs I'm subscribed to (FeedDemon already reports me today that there are thousands(!) of unread posts waiting for me.)

Anyway, I'm taking my EOS 350D (labeled [Rebel XT](http://www.usa.canon.com/consumer/controller?act=ModelDetailAct&fcategoryid=139&modelid=11154 "Canon EOS Digital Rebel XT") in the US) to Mexico, and I borrowed a 70-300mm telephoto lens from a colleague. I hope I can take some nice pictures and post them here. See you in two weeks [:)]
