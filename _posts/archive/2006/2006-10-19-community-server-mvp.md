[![Community Server MVP](/files/archive/csmvp.gif)](http://csmvps.com){: .align-right}

[The news is out](http://communityserver.org/blogs/announcements/archive/2006/10/19/new-community-server-mvps.aspx): Today [Telligent](http://telligent.com/) awarded me a [Community Server MVP](http://csmvps.com/). Though I am not that active in the fora, my participation in the CS community were deemed worthy enough to justify the nomination. At least my [contribution](/archive/2006/08/22/the-akismet-spam-rule-included-in-alabaster/) to the [Alabaster CSModule package](http://csmvps.com/blogs/news/archive/2006/08/14/Community-Server-MVP_2700_s-Alabaster-CSModule-Package.aspx) is legalized now.

Congratulations to [Dave Stokes](http://www.davestokes.net/) and [Russ Goldin](http://communityserver.org/members/rgoldin.aspx), who were awarded too.

I'm curious if [Keyvan](http://nayyeri.net/)'s [comment about MVP programs](http://nayyeri.net/archive/2006/10/12/some-words-about-mvp-programs.aspx) got Telligent mediate on new nominations. ;)

Anyway, I feel honored, and looking forward to the collaboration with Telligent. Can't wait to get hands on CS 3.0...
