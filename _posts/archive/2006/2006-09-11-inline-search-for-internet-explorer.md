> As an [Emacs](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) user, I've grown usedto having inline search as a feature and often get frustrated when the applicationI'm using doesn't support its. It's great to see this feature added to Internet Explorer.I just downloaded it and it works great with the most recent beta of [InternetExplorer 7](http://www.microsoft.com/windows/ie/ie7/about/default.mspx). Give it a shot.

I've added the site tomy bookmark list and will check it out later today to see if there any other interesting IE extensions I've been missing out on.

I fully agree. For the same reason I switched from [Notepad2](http://www.flos-freeware.ch/notepad2.html) to [Notepad++](http://notepad-plus.sourceforge.net/). However, I changed the shortcut for Incremental Search from <kbd>Ctrl-Alt-I</kbd> to <kbd>Ctrl-I</kbd> which I'm accustomed to by Visual Studio.
