After the great success of our last year's [.NET Summit](http://www.event-team.com/events/NETSummitNRW/), our .NET user group is proud to announce the [NRW06 Community Conference](http://www.nrw06.de/):

More than [20 speakers](http://www.vfl-niederrhein.net/Speakers.aspx), up to 250 attendees.

And before you say: not another summit of Microsoft lovers: we also have talks about PHP and Linux (do you know [Patrick Lauer](http://gentooexperimental.org/%7Epatrick/weblog/)?)

Anyway, don't hesitate to [register](http://www.vfl-niederrhein.net/Signup.aspx). Everyone's welcome.
