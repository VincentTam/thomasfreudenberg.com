At the last meeting of our [UserGroup](http://www.vfl-niederrhein.net/) I've presented a list of tools I'm using frequently. Because of strong demand I promised to publish it here on my blog:

### General Tools and System Tweaking

[TweakUI](http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/downloads/powertoys/xppowertoys.mspx)  
This PowerToy gives you access to system settings that are not exposed in the Windows XP default user interface, including mouse settings, Explorer settings, taskbar settings, and more.

[ClearType Tuner PowerToy](http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/downloads/powertoys/xppowertoys.mspx)  
This PowerToy lets you use ClearType technology to make it easier to read text on your screen, and installs in the Control Panel for easy access.

[TaskSwitchXP](http://www.ntwind.com/taskswitchxp/)  
is a replacement for the standard Windows Alt-Tab switcher, which adds visual styles to the dialog and offers a thumbnail preview. It can also minimize applications to the taskbar notification area by right-clicking their minimize button.

[LClock](http://www.neowin.net/forum/index.php?showtopic=157465)  
An enhanced clock for the taskbar notification area.

[MSN Toolbar Suite](http://toolbar.msn.com/)  
No need to describe this, right?

[NotePad2](http://www.flos-freeware.ch/notepad2.html)  
A nifty lightweight notepad replacement.

[4NT](http://jpsoft.com/4ntdes.htm)  
A powerful command line processor.

[Synergy](http://synergy2.sourceforge.net/)  
Allows you to share a single mouse and keyboard between multiple computers. I use to control both my desktop and my laptop with the devices attached to the desktop. It even synchronizes the clipboard.

[SpamBayes](http://spambayes.org)  
An anti-spam Outlook add-in using a Bayesian filter.

[Plaxo](http://www.plaxo.com/)  
Synchronizes my contacts and appointments between my work and my home machines.

[ClipPath](http://www.download.com/ClipPath/3000-2094_4-10050927.html?tag=free)  
A little shell extension which copies the selected files path to the clipboard. One of those little tools which value you don't appreciate until you need it.

[FolderShare](http://www.foldershare.com/)  
Synchronizes files between multiple computers. Bought by Microsoft last year

### Developer's Friends

[SysInternals' Tools](http://www.sysinternals.com)  
[DebugView](http://www.sysinternals.com/Utilities/DebugView.html), [Process Explorer](http://www.sysinternals.com/Utilities/ProcessExplorer.html), [PsTools,](http://www.sysinternals.com/Utilities/PsTools.html)[FileMon](http://www.sysinternals.com/Utilities/Filemon.html), and [RegMon](http://www.sysinternals.com/Utilities/Regmon.html).

[Dependancy Walker](http://www.dependencywalker.com/)  
Scans any Win32 module and builds a hierarchical tree diagram of all dependent modules.

[psubst](http://www.alter.org.ua/soft/win/psubst/index.php?lang=en)  
Similar to *subst*, but persistent, i.e. the substitutions are kept after reboots.

[WinCvs](http://wincvs.org/) and [TortoiseCVS](http://www.tortoisecvs.org/)  
The former is a stand-alone GUI client for [CVS](http://www.cvshome.org/), while the latter is a shell extension.

[BeyondCompare](http://scootersoftware.com/)  
A powerful file and folder comparison utility.

[ReSharper](http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/)  
A refactoring add-in for Visual Studio, which also supports enhanced highlighting (including errors and warnings), intellisense, and much more.

[TestDriven.NET](http://www.testdriven.net/)  
An unit testing add-in for Visual Studio.

[Reflector](http://www.aisto.com/roeder/dotnet/)  
A .NET class browser.

[GhostDoc](http://www.roland-weigelt.de/ghostdoc/)  
An add-in for Visual Studio automating the creation of XML documentation comments.

That's it for today. I bet the real list of tools on my machine is more than two times as long as the list above, so perhaps I'll update this post later... at least I've planned so.
