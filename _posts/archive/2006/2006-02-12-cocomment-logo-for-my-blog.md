Jayson Knight [requested](/archive/2006/02/12/more-cocomment/) a logo for coComment to put on his blog. Though I think he refered to the comment form, I created two different "blog buttons" (or how these 80x15 images are called). Here they are:

-   ![](/files/archive/cocomment.gif) is shown on every page and indicates that my blog supports coComment. It links to my coComment conversations.
-   ![](/files/archive/coenabled.gif) is used in the comment form to inform the user that she can use coComment with my blog.

**Update:** I added a small explanation to define the scope of each of the images.
