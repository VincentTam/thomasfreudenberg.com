[JÃ¶rgen Sigvardsson](http://www.codeproject.com/script/profile/whos_who.asp?id=15093) published his [KDE Mouse Emulator](http://www.codeproject.com/useritems/kdemouse.asp) at CodeProject:

> In KDE (a desktop environment for Unix operating systems), windows can be moved and resized without having to click on window edges or going through menus. To move a window, simply press ALT and press left mouse button and reposition the window by moving the mouse. To resize a window, press the right mouse button instead, and adjust the position of the bottom right corner by moving the mouse.

I installed it only a few hours ago and am already used to it.
