[Dave Burke](http://dbvt.com/) mentioned on [CS Daily News last Monday](http://communityserver.org/blogs/dailynews/archive/2006/10/02/550666.aspx "Community Server Daily News") that both [MSDN Blogs](http://blogs.msdn.com/ "MSDN Blogs") and [TechNet Blogs](http://blogs.technet.com/ "TechNet Blogs") have been updated to Community Server 2.1. However, in my opinion they missed to make use of one of CS's most interesting new features: tag support.

I used to have MSDN Blogs' mainfeed in my aggregator, but deleted the subscription almost one year ago. There are just too many bloggers, and the signal-to-noise ratio is somewhat low. Therefore, instead of subscribing the main feed I'd rather subscribe to specific global tags, e.g. [CLR](http://blogs.msdn.com/tags/CLR/) or [WPF](http://blogs.msdn.com/tags/WPF/).

Fortunately, it's already there. You may have noticed in the previous paragraph that both CLR and WPF are hyperlinks. So tags are there, it's just that they are not first-class citizens. In fact, the links to the sites' [tag clouds](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tag_cloud) are <http://blogs.msdn.com/tags/> and <http://blogs.technet.com/tags/>. So I ask, "Why aren't these links on the sites' home pages?"

(However, of course the global tagging system works only if all bloggers commit to a common set of terms. If one tags his posts with WPF, another one Windows Presentation Foundation, and a third one uses Avalon, you would have to subscribe to all three of these terms.)
