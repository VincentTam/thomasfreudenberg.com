I just want to note that [my last post](/archive/2006/08/21/mixing-c-and-vb-net-in-one-assembly/) was brought to youÂ by [Windows Live Writer](http://windowslivewriter.spaces.live.com/blog/cns!D85741BB5E0BE8AA!174.entry) and [Code Syntax Highlighter](http://www.codeplex.com/Wiki/View.aspx?ProjectName=WLWPlugins).

Till now I always used Community Server's editing facilities, but often enough I lost my drafts for several reasons. WLW provides an auto-save option, which would have saved me a lot of time in the past.

But the coolest feature of WLW is its extensibility. Keyvan Nayyeri wrote a [nice tutorial](http://nayyeri.net/archive/2006/08/15/Write-a-Windows-Live-Writer-plugin-using-C_2300_.aspx) about how to create a Technorati tag plugin.
