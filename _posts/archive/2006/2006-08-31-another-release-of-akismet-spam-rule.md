My [Akismet spam rule](/archive/2006/08/22/the-akismet-spam-rule-included-in-alabaster/) has a second home. Originally I contributed it to CSMVP's CSModules package aka [Alabaster](http://csmvps.com/blogs/news/archive/2006/08/14/Community-Server-MVP_2700_s-Alabaster-CSModule-Package.aspx). A couple of days ago [José Lema](http://www.tankete.com/core/blogs/jose_lema/) informed me that Telligent wants to release a free dedicated spam rule package, and they would like to include my rule as well. First I hesitated relinquishing my baby, but hey, the more users get easier access to that rule, the less spam they'll get. So finally I agreed José to include my rule in their package.

Yesterday José [announced](http://communityserver.org/forums/thread/546533.aspx) the availability of that spam rule package, and indeed my spam rule is not included in it, but available [on its own](http://communityserver.org/files/folders/community_spam_rules/default.aspx). That means I still have full control over it **and** more people will use it. So if you don't want to use Alabaster (though you might miss other great CSModules) you can get the [Akismet spam rule as a stand-alone component](http://communityserver.org/files/folders/community_spam_rules/default.aspx).

Happy spam-fighting.
