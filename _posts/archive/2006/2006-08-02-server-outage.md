As my two readers may already have noticed, my site wasn't accessible for the last 24hrs. The SQL Server hosting my Community Server database had a hard disk failure, and it took them some time to find the backup tapes [:S]

Apparently they found the backup, and my site is alive again. I used the time to change the skin of my blog to Paperclip with a custom header image as [described by Keyvan](http://nayyeri.net/archive/2006/07/21/How-to-replace-Community-Server-Paperclip-blog-skin_2700_s-top-image.aspx).
