This site has been upgraded to CommunityServer 2007 (I guess visitors to my site do know CommunityServer, and they already read the [announcements](http://communityserver.org/forums/t/486717.aspx).) Of all all CS MVPs, I am again late to the party [;)]

The upgrade was pretty easy. I spent about 2 hours on it, mainly because of my limited upload bandwidth. However, I had to create a new CS2007 package, because all the cool extensions I used for my old installation are not yet released for CS2007. But don´t worry, the CS MVPs are busy upgrading the CSMVP CSModule package.

I started to create my own theme a couple of weeks ago, but because of lack of time and CSS experience, it´s not finished yet. Therefore my site still looks the same as before.

BTW, Starting with CS 2007 there´s a new distributable called "One-Click Install"?. This package is a kinda XCOPY distribution, using [Cassini](http://www.asp.net/Projects/Cassini/Download/) and a file-based database. It's great for developers because you neither need to configure IIS nor the SQL Server.
