Generally I limit my posts to programming stuff, but after I read Kathy Sierra's [Death threats against bloggers are NOT "protected speech"? (why I cancelled my ETech presentations)](http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/2007/03/as_i_type_this_.html) I have to break my habit.

If you don't know Kathy, she's one of my favorite bloggers. Her [Creating Passionate Users](http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/) should not only mandatory for UI developers, but gives insightful views on user experience every developer and manager should be aware of.

[This sucks](http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/2007/03/as_i_type_this_.html).

**Update 1:** [Scoble stops blogging](http://scobleizer.com/2007/03/26/taking-the-week-off/) for one week, because he, as many others, feels with Kathy.
