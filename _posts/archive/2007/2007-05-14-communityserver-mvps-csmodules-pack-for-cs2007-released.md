Yesterday a new version of the CSMVPs CSModules package was released. Except the new LinkManager (which enables you to add customizable attributes to links in your posts automatically) itÂ´s mainly a technical refresh targeting CommunityServer 2007 (SP1).

Read the full announcement is available on the [CS MVP site](http://csmvps.com/blogs/news/archive/2007/05/13/community-server-mvps-cinnabar-csmodule-package.aspx).
