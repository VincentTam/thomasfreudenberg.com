Now Germany has its own Mix conference, though here Microsoft calls it [Xtopia](http://www.xtopia-konferenz.de/). It will cover Silverlight, WPF, the Expression suite, and much more. It will take place in Berlin from 10th to 12th of October (if you include the post-conference on Friday).

I'll go to Berlin tomorrow already, and stay until Saturday. My Hotel is the [Quality Hotel & Suites Berlin City East](http://www.quality-hotel-berlin.de/en/). If you want to join me for a beer or two, drop me a line or call me at +49 (173) 285 21 81. [Lars](http://blog.lars-keller.net/PermaLink,guid,331497aa-dee3-4a90-a81b-126f2727f292.aspx), I'm expecting your call.
