After more than 8 years I´ll leave my current employer [Cycos](http://www.cycos.com/ "Cycos") by the end of this year. Starting 1/1/08 I'll work as a Senior Software Developer at [Proximity](http://www.proximity.de/ "Proximity") ([international website](http://www.proximityworldwide.com/ "Proximity worldwide").)

Cycos is my first employer, I started here right after university in 1999. Originally I didn't plan to stay that long here but 5 years at maximum. However, because the work was so diversified and the working atmosphere so prolific, I stayed some years longer. E.g. I was delegated to Munich and San Jose (CA) for several month each, and they paid me the attendances and expenses for both PDC´03 and ´05 in LA. In other words, I can´t accuse myself of being inflexible or inmobil. And it was always fun working at Cycos. I´ll be contended if the working atmosphere at my new job is half as prolific as I got to know it in the past.

However, after 8 years it´s time for a change. Most of my time at Cycos I wrote proprietary software, mainly clients for [computer telephony integration](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/computer%20telephony%20integration). In contrast, at Proximity I will leverage Microsoft products such as MOSS and BizTalk, i.e. areas ~~I don´t have a clue about~~ where I can gain experience. But don´t get me wrong, I´m really looking forward for the new job.

And I´m not only changing the employer, but the town as well. I´ll move to Hamburg, which is 500 km away from Würselen/Aachen (for my American friends: that´s about 310 miles). Therefore the search of a new domicile has my highest priority at the moment. I have 18 paid leave days left, and I want to complete my relocation this year. So this blog will stay quite silent the next few weeks. But stay tuned, I´ll keep you informed.
