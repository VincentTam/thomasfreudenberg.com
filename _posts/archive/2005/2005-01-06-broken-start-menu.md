![Broken Start Menu](/files/archive/startmenu.png)

Every now and then my start menu is broken. I.e. the left area normally showing last used applications is black, and sub menus for items such as "All Programs", "Administrative Tools" do not open.

Google led me to this [forum thread](http://www.uwm.edu/%7Ebobtreat/messages/343.shtml), where they blame the *Logitech Webcam Software*, so I've uninstalled this. I hope this will help...
