I've disabled comments, since comment spam gets out of hands. As you see in the header of this site, there are currently 8374 comments counted. However, forget about 8000. These are all spam!

Besides, I'm preparing for a migration to [CommunityServer](http://communityserver.org/). Currently, I'm struggling with HTML and CSS to get a decent skin. And I hope I'll find a immaculate solution to get rid of the comment spam. So the update of my site is only a question of, er, weeks.
