> According to Brad Wardell's blog on JoeUser.com, Microsoft has released a preliminary version of the UX guidelines to help developers write applications that look and take advantage of the new Vista glass user experience.

> The UX guidelines are a series of web pages that can be downloaded directly from Microsoft. For those of you that do not want to download the web pages, I have placed all of them up on my web server for everyone to view.
