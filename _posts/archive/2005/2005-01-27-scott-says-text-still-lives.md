Finally, Scott answered to my previous series of posts, via mail as well as on his blog. I'm happy that Scott seems to understand my point. Sometimes I get stuck for the right words, and after getting first feedback to my posts, I noticed that it you may understand them the wrong way. But he didn't.

Anyway, Scott started his answer as follows:

> So a common question the last couple of days, "*Is .Text Dead*" ?
>
> Absolutely not. No way. Nie..Nao. Het.
>
> Just to be clear:
>
> -   Community Server is the evolution of .Text (I consider CS 1.0 to be the missing .Text 1.0)
> -   There will be a free upgrade tool to upgrade a .Text install to CS 1.0
> -   You 100% can run Community Server Blogs, without galleries and forums. (as you can run forums without blogs, etc)
> -   We will ship the source code (to keep things simple, we have held on to the source until we ship 1.0)
> -   You will be able to contribute

I have expected the first two points. The third item is good news for all who want a blog only. What I really like are the two last statements.

Further down his post Scott gives a rough overview of new features:

> Set up and configuration is now infinitely easier and more flexible.
>
> -   We have a web based installer
> -   A new virtualization model capable of not only running multiple sites on a single install but the ability to use shard or unique users
> -   UI for creating and managing blogs
> -   Secured/control access to blogs (globally and individually)
>
> General Features
>
> -   Built in search
> -   Support for medium trust environments
> -   More flexible URL overrides
> -   Ratings
> -   Comments
>     -   Moderated
>     -   Authenticated only
>     -   Timed (i.e., new comments for 1, 2, etc days)
>     -   You can both hide all comments and/or turn them off
> -   A much simpler and documented skin layer
> -   Much simpler and less restrictive UrlRewriting
> -   Posts can be dated for the future (and will not be visible until then)
> -   Multiple authors per blog
> -   Role and Permission based access (i.e., users in role X have Post access while users in role Y have read-only access)
> -   Email subscriptions by post and blog
> -   Updated CSS Hierarchy

Well, it looks very promising. Yes, it does. Many mods published by people as [Dave Burke](http://dbvt.com/blog), [Don Demsak](http://donxml.com/), [Dan Bartels](http://www.danbartels.com/), and others will already part of CS::Blogs.

I don't want to repeat every single word of Scott. [Read it yourself](http://scottwater.com/blog/archive/2005/01/27/rumors_of_my_demise_have_been_greatly_exaggerated). He explains the reasons for the long delay since the last release of .Text very well.

He closes his post with

> We have one minor issue to clear up and we will be releasing a release candidate to Community Sever 1.0 have already started working on plans/features for 1.1/1.2/2.0 (current plan calls for two point releases before 2.0).
>
> To summarize, we are still making progress and if you have the time/desire to contribute, we would welcome you to contribute to CS.

One thing missing is the release date. I have many items on my to-do list. I want to adopt several mods, and have lots of additional ideas I want to realize in .Text. Is it worth to start implementing them, or should I wait for the release of CS::Blog (incl the sources)?
