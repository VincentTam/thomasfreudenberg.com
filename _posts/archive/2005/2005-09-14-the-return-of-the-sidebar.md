The sidebar's back. Microsoft presented it to us two years ago, but in succeeding CTPs it was gone. Now it's back and you can add so-called gadgets. To speak in Apple terms, think of sidebar and gadgets as dashboard and widgets. You can write own your gadgets using WPF or DHTML, and they even launched [Microsoft Gadgets](http://microsoftgadgets.com/) yesterday, a site dedicated to gadget development.
