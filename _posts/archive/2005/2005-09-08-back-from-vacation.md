Two days ago my girl friend and I returned from our vacation on [Fuerteventura](http://www.fuerteventura.com/). Most of the time we were hanging around at the beach or the hotel's pool, but we have rented a Jeep for three days to explore the island. Though Fuerteventura is a relatively deserted island, I love this minimalistic landscape. If you're looking for quiet and recreative vacation, I can really recommend this island.

I'm now back in Germany for three two days. On Saturday I'll take off to LA to attend the PDC. I'll arrive on Saturday afternoon, so after having a good night's rest I am going use Sunday and Monday to explore LA before the PDC starts on Tuesday.
