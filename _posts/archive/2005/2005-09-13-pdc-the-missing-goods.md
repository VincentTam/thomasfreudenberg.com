Today we got The Goods, almost 30GB of geek stuff. It's a box containing 6 DVD's:

1.  Windows Vista Beta 1 (incl. SDK)
2.  Visual Studio 2005 Team System Beta 2
3.  SQL Server 2005 June CTP, Virtual PC 2004, Virtual Server 2005 R2 Beta, Windows Server 2003 R2 RC0
4.  WinFX plus other stuff such as whitepapers
5.  Windows Vista CTP: PDC05
6.  Windows Server Codename "Longhorn" CTP: PDC05

But wait, something missing here. There are only 5 discs in my box, no Longhorn Server. I think I have to object that tomorrow.

Anyway, lots of cool stuff to play aroud with.

**Update:** I was informed that we'll get the sixth disc tomorrow. Sorry for any inconveniences.
