The journey was a mess. My flight from DÃ¼sseldorf on Saturday was scheduled for 7:15am. Unfortunately, it was cancelled, and the next flight was at 2:05pm, so I had to kill nearly 7 hours at the airport. I arrived in LA at 19:00 local time, more than 28 hours after I get up in Germany. I used Sunday and Monday for some sightseeing, I visited the Rodeo Drive, Hollywood, Venice, and Santa Monica. If someone wants to offer me a job in LA, well, don't hesitate to contact me ;-)

Anyway, meanwhile it's Tuesday morning, and I already had my breakfast in the LACC. Thirty minutes left till [PDC](http://channel9.msdn.com/tags/pdc05) officially starts with the keynotes of Bill Gates and Jim Allchin...
