> During “Keynote" audiance advised they would have the chance to buy the iMate JASJAR (normall $1100) for $149. This meant some people bailed out to go and buy. The majority stayed and watched - of course. Only 1000 available so sold out while the majority watched the keynote. This really sucks. Microsoft should have had enough for all to buy.

 

I totally agree on this. While those leaving the keynote can buy all the devices, the others are penalized for staying.
