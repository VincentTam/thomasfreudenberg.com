> Microsoft released a [new power toy](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=d48e808e-b10d-4ce4-a141-5866fd4a3286&displaylang=en) for viewing RAW images (currently Canon and Nikon only supported).

There are two downloads available, a "lite" version which only includes the power toy, and the "full" version which contains the power toy along with the .NET framework 1.1. But I'm wondering about their sizes: the "lite" is about 6.5MB, while "full" is 49MB big. So the included framework takes 49MB - 6.5MB = 42.5MB! That's twice as much as the standalone .NET setup (~23MB IIRC).
