Finally, several month after the initial release of [CommunityServer](http://communityserver.org/) I've managed to migrate from dotText. With the help from [Kevin Harder](http://kevinharder.com/)'s [DotText-CS-Converter](http://kevinharder.com/communityserver/default.aspx#DotText-CS-Converter) and [Ken Robertson](http://www.qgyen.net/)'s [SiteUrls Generator](http://www.qgyen.net/csaddins/singlesite/) I was even able to preserve the old site structure.

"Why CommunityServer," you may ask. There more as I [ranted](/archive/2005/01/26/bringing-text-v-96-further/) about dotText and its progress back in January. Well, I could have stayed with dotText (or [subText](http://subtextproject.com/)), but I like the bigger community of CommunityServer with supporters like [Dan Bartels](http://www.danbartels.com/), <span class="normal">[John Pike](http://offshotthought.com/), et al. I'd like to mention [Dave Burke](http://dbvt.com/) as well, though he seems to have retired from CommunityServer enhancements.</span>

Another reason for switching to CommunityServer is that I've bought a [Canon EOS 350D](http://www.canon-europe.com/For_Home/Product_Finder/Cameras/Digital_SLR/EOS_350C/), and maybe I need an online gallery one day for a picture or two.

As you may already have noticed I've designed my own theme. Unfortunately, it's not as close to my own demands as I like to, but I'm a little bit in a hurry. On Tuesday my girl friend and I will be on vacation on [Fuerteventura](http://www.fuerteventura.com/) for two weeks, and when I'm back I have three days before I take off again, this time to L.A. Yes, I am going to attend the [PDC](http://msdn.microsoft.com/events/pdc/). I've been there two years ago, and it was awesome.

Well, maybe it wasn't a good idea to switch the blog engine two days before my vacation. But since there wasn't any mentionable content on this site for months, nobody will notice if something goes terrible wrong here.

After the PDC I'll have more time to tinker with the site's design, and maybe I'll even able to contribute some stuff to the CommunityServer community.
