Many announcements and blog posts regarding UR2 for MCE have been published during the last few days. But for me as a developer the most interesting change I've discovered in Michael Creasy's [Update Rollup 2 for WIndows XP Media Center Edition is live!](http://michaelcreasy.com/blog/index.php?title=update_rollup_2_for_windows_xp_media_cen&more=1&c=1&tb=1&pb=1):

> **.NET Framework 1.1 support**
> Media Center now uses version 1.1 of the .NET Framework. Add-ins can now be built using 1.1, but 1.0 addins will still work.
