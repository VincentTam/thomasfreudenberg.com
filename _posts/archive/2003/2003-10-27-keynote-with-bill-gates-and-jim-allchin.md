The first time I've seen Bill Gates in real live. He spoke much about the past development of the IT industry and presented the Microsoft's vision for the next few years. Nice to see some self-critism.

Jim Allchin's presentation got more into the bits, with several coding sessions with [Don Box](http://www.gotdotnet.com/team/dbox/) and [Chris Anderson](http://www.simplegeek.com/). They did a good job, and Don even managed to involve Jim as his coding monkey ![Wink](/files/archive/smiley_wink.gif). Anyway, Don and Chris did some simple coding with XAML and [Indigo](http://www.gotdotnet.com/team/dbox/default.aspx?key=2003-10-27T06:59:40Z). Quite impressive.

I did some pictures, but unfortunately, I've forgotten my camera's USB cable in my hotel. I'll publish them later.
