> If a packet hits a pocket on a socket on a port,
> And the bus is interrupted as a very last resort,
> And the address of the memory makes your floppy disk abort,
> Then the socket packet pocket has an error to report!
> If your cursor finds a menu item followed by a dash,
> And the double-clicking icons put your window in the trash,
> And your data is corrupted 'cause the index doesn't hash,
> Then your situation's hopeless, and your system's gonna crash!
> If the label on your cable on the gable at your house,
> Says the network is connected to the button on your mouse,
> And the microcode instructions cause unnecessary RISC,
> Then you have to flash your memory and you'll want to RAM your ROM,
> Quickly turn off your computer and be sure to tell your mom!

> But your packets want to tunnel to another protocol,
> That's repeatedly rejected by the printer down the hall.
> And your screen is all distorted by the side effects of gauss,
> So your icons in the window are as wavy as a souse,
> Then you may as well reboot and go out with a bang,
> "Cause as sure as I'm a poet, the sucker's gonna hang!
> When the copy of your floppy's getting sloppy on the disk,
