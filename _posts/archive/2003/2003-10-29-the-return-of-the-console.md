I've never stopped using the console since the good old DOS. In fact, each developer at our [company](http://www.cycos.com/) is using the console, i.e. [4NT](http://www.jpsoft.com/4ntdes.htm). Our development environment depends heavily on the console, the complete build and deployment process is realized with batch files.

What really suprised me at the PDC is Microsoft's homage to the console.

1.  In more of half of the sessions I attended you were able to see the speaker using the console. Probably that's mainly a plug for the new [MSBuild](/archive/2003/10/27/tls347-introducing-msbuild-the-universal-build-engine-for-visual-studio-whidbey-and-longhorn/) tool. But anyway, they're using it.
2.  With the next version of the CLR you're able to colorize the output to the console.

However, it's sad to see people [who don't know anything about the console](http://www.codeproject.com/threads/pausep.asp?msg=296675#xx296675xx)...
