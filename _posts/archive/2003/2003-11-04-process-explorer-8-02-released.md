[SysInternals](http://www.sysinternals.com/) have released [Process Explorer 8.02](http://www.sysinternals.com/ntw2k/freeware/procexp.shtml) a few days ago.

> Another major Process Explorer update on the heels of v7.0 brings a slew of enhancements in addition to a more menu options: only non-zero CPU usage is displayed (you'll wonder why Task Manager doesn't do this), replace Task Manager with a new option, see interrupt and DPC time, view context switch counts, look inside .NET processes, configure highlight colors, view CPU usage in a color-coded tray icon, and much more.
