[As announced](/archive/2003/10/13/moving-this-site/) I've managed to move my site from my home system to [webhost4life](http://www.webhost4life.com/default.asp?refid=thoemmi). I have had some troubleÂ importing my SQL database to the host's server, but thanks to the helpdesk staff I finally succeeded.

Now I have to become acquainted with redirections, since all links to my old site (<http://thoemmi.dyndns.org/>) should be transferred permanently to <http://thomasfreudenberg.com/>. Additionally, I've renamed the blog from *TFr* to *[blog](/)*, since it's more convenient ![Wink](/files/archive/smiley_wink.gif)
