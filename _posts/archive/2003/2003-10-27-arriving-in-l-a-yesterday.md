After 12 hours of flying I arrived yesterday in Los Angeles. Though I heared about the current fires around L.A. in German news, I was surprised by the dark and grey sky. I hope they're able to fight it.

Anyway, I was quite tired, since I was awake for about 25 houres. I thought about attending one pre-conference session or two, but finally I preferred to get some sleep.
