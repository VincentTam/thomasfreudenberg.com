As [announced](http://www.codeproject.com/script/rumor/article.asp?msg=651762&id=285#xx651762xx), CPians attending the PDC met this afternoon at the Starbucks coffee stand. It was my first time I met any CPian in real life. I was a little bit disappointed, that only a few people came by. However, you missed your T-shirts, so I got two ![Tongue out](/files/archive/smiley_tongue.gif)

Anyway, here's a photo I took:
