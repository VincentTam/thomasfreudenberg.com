OneÂ and half week ago, Microsoft released Office 2003 for MSDN subscribers. Only Office 2003. When I went to subscriber downloads to get MapPoint 2004 today, I discovered that now there's Frontpage 2003, OneNote, and some more to download as well. Additionally, Office is available in 14 languages by now.
