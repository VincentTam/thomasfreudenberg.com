[What's up](http://new.blogger.com/home.pyra) at bloggers:

> **Free Features for Everyone**  Good news, folks! The feature wagon just arrived and dropped off a host of bloggity goodness at rock-bottom prices. And we're passing the savings on to you! That is, we're rolling in a bunch of features that will give you more powerful and flexible publishing power (for free). Want to know what's included?

Seems as the buyout by [Google](http://www.google.com/) pays off. Most of the features, which required a Pro account ($35 p.a.) till now, are free for everyone.
