I haven't blogged since a few days. That's because stayed another two days after the PDC in Los Angeles, but I didn't have any web access. By the way, these two days in L.A. were a mess, since the public transportation is on strike since three weeks. Thus I haven't seen that much of the City of Angels ![Sad](/files/archive/smiley_frown.gif)

Anyway, in the meantime it's Tuesday, and I have installed Longhorn on two boxes, one at work and one at home. Unfortunately, Longhorn doesn't include the proper network drivers. Though I could use the Windows XP drivers for my machine at  work (which board is a [ASUS P4C800 Deluxe](http://www.asus.com/products/mb/socket478/p4c800-d/overview.htm) with an Intel 875P chipset), I wasn't able to get my home machine online ([ASUS A7N8X](http://www.asus.com/products/mb/socketa/a7n8x/overview.htm) with nVidia nForce2), not even with the Windows XP drivers... does anyone else have such a set-up? I'd like to use my home PC as my primary "*Longhorn experience center*."
