[Raymond Chen](http://blogs.gotdotnet.com/raymondc/) [mentions](http://blogs.gotdotnet.com/raymondc/permalink.aspx/5240117f-ef43-4336-9d2c-1cf7ecf8e7ac) [Jason Moore](http://blogs.gotdotnet.com/jasmo/)'s [Usability on the cheap, Part 1](http://blogs.gotdotnet.com/jasmo/PermaLink.aspx/66242dc8-fdfb-44c6-a3d3-cf229dad609d). It's a great reading, especially for GUI guys like me.

However, I think the most important fact in the post is hidden in the second footnote:

> Users being too busy is one of the basic rules of UI. Users aren't stupid, they aren't blind, they aren't incapable: they are just too busy to learn your UI. Humility is good for user experience.

BTW, this and [Peter Provost](http://www.peterprovost.org/)'s post about [missing documentation](http://www.peterprovost.org/weblog/permalink.aspx?guid=6a634ba7-5ee2-4fdd-bfee-dbe840f24dbb) reminded me in [Joel Spolsky](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/)'s [User Interface Design foor Programmers, Chapter 6](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/uibook/chapters/fog0000000062.html):

> 1.  Users don't have the manual, and if they did, they wouldn't read it.
> 2.  In fact, users can't read anything, and if they could, they wouldn't want to.

I really recommend that book.
