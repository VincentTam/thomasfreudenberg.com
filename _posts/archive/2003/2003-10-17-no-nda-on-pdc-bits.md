[Robert Scoble](http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/) [says](http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2003/10/17.html#a5071):

> NDA-centric culture. There are no NDAs at the PDC over the PDC content. Enough said. But, we still are far too NDA-oriented. So, I'll give us a "B" on that score. Improvement still needed.

AFAIK the first time Microsoft gives away early bits without any NDA ![OMG](/files/archive/smiley_omg.gif)
