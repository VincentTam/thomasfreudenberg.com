Just started blogging. Well, sort of. In fact, I'm already blogging for two month by now,  but restricted to the intranet in our company [Cycos](http://www.cycos.com/).

My first contact with weblogs was back in March this year. I've stumbled over the blog of [Don Box](http://www.gotdotnet.com/team/dbox/). That was my starting point for my journey across the fascinating world of blogs. I don't now which aggregator I used first, but for several month I'm using [SharpReader](http://www.sharpreader.net/). This app has this nice feature called *threading*. It encourages you to follow the URLs linked in a RSS post.

The idea to start my own blog conceived some time ago. Not that I've much to tell you ;-) It's more the technical point of view. In May I've installed [BlogX](http://www.gotdotnet.com/Community/Workspaces/Workspace.aspx?id=ddc98753-6559-489b-a533-57034790a93a) at work and studied the sources. But one feature I'm missing is the support for multiple user (bloggers, is that), because I plan to establish a *blog culture* in our development department. But that's another story.

Anyway, I've been waiting for several weeks for the sources of [.Text](http://www.gotdotnet.com/Community/Workspaces/workspace.aspx?id=e99fccb3-1a8c-42b5-90ee-348f6b77c407), which drives <Weblogs@ASP.NET>. Finally, [Scott Watermasysk](http://scottwater.com/blog/) released it three weeks ago.

Now I have a fresh installation of .Text at home. Since I'm connected via [T-DSL](http://www.t-dsl.com/), I get a dynamic IP only. Therefore, I've created an account at [dyndns.org](http://dyndns.org/). Don't wonder, if this page is not available every now and then ;-).

I think it's enough for my very first posting. Oh, one last point: I'm German, so please excuse my English...
