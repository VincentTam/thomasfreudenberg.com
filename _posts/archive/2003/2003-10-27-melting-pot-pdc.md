This morning I meet Tom, a nice guy from North Carolina. We took our breakfast together. Afterwards, while waiting for a taxi in front of the hotel, a Austrian guy joined us, so we shared the cab. The quite extroverted taxi driver is from Israel.

I could't avoid to think of [Roy Osherove](http://weblogs.asp.net/rosherove/)'s [posting](http://weblogs.asp.net/rosherove/posts/31828.aspx):

> Ali is Iranian, I'm an Israeli. Our countries are enemies. We don't necessarily agree with everything the other one believes in. Yet we talked. I won't repeat the chat because I didn't tell him I'd post about it. But the fact is we **talked** even through our political issues with each other. Yet another way technology brings us closer together.

Not that I (or Germany) is in any war currently. But I too think that technology breaks many barriers.
