I know I'm a geek. These pages are hosted on my server at home. It's a recycled Athlon XP 1800+ running Windows Server 2003 incl IIS 6.0, MS SQL 2000 and MS Exchange 2003. It's connected via [T-DSL](http://www.t-dsl.com/) (768/128 KBit/s).

Though this is a *geekish* set-up, I'm thinking about changed that for several reasons:

1.  **Economics**
    Because this machine is hosting my pages and running the mail server, it is running 24/7. How much am I at home at my machine? Well, about 3 hours in average. Plus it's a machine I cannot use for anything else.
2.  **Noise**
    The server is the loudest of all my machines. Of course I could tweak it by exchanging the fans etc, but I'm too lazy... ![Blushing](/files/archive/smiley_redface.gif)
3.  **My girl friend needs a PC**
    She moved in two month ago, and she only has my old Celeron w/400 MHz I gave her some time ago. SHe needs her own machine, but since she just started in her job, she doesn't have the money.
4.  **Bandwidth**
    While 768KBit/s downstream is fully sufficient for browsing and downloading some MSDN packages every now and then, 128KBit/s upstream is quite restrictive for serving pages.

Therefore, I decided to move my site to a dedicated hosting service. I've already chosen [WebHost4Life](http://www.webhost4life.com/) cause of the many credits I've read about them. However, what is left is a decent domain name... ![Expressionless](/files/archive/smiley_line.gif)
