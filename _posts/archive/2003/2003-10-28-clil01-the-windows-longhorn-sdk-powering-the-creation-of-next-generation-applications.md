Today I got an email from a coworker about the meaning of WinFX: "Is WinFX a new marketing name for .NET"?

No, it isn't. WinFX is the managed API, the SDK of Longhorn. Steven Goulet, the speaker of this session, said: *Everything in Longhorn is in the SDK*. Or: *What's not on the SDK, is not in the OS*.

Steven has done some comparison between the .NET framework 1.0 and WinFX:

**Good news about the documentation:**

The documentation is currently about 200.000 pages (Oxford English Dictionary has about 22.000)

Longhorn SDK *Vegas*: Next Generation Longhorn SDK content delivery and publishing/viewing technology.

There will be no Platform SDK for Longhorn, only WinFX.

The documentation is living, i.e. it will be updated regularly via Internet, the help pages will have kind of a discussion forum attached, so build-in feedback.
