It seemed as [Feed Validator](http://feedvalidator.org/) didn't like me. When I checked it said it can't validate my [RSS feed](http://thoemmi.dyndns.org/tfr/rss.aspx). However, loading my feed within a web browser looked ok. Therefore, I wrote an email to [Mark](http://diveintomark.org/) and [Sam](http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/) this morning. I've got following reply:

> Yeah, that's a known bug.  It's not your fault at all.  It's a server configuration issue on the new server, and Sam and I are actively working on a fix.  (It affects his feed too.)
>
> Thanks for the report.  We'll announce at <http://feedvalidator.org/news/> when we have a fix.

> -Mark

Thanks in advance, Mark.

PS: BTW, I cannot find a RSS feed for the Feed Validator News ![WTF](/files/archive/smiley_WTF.gif)
