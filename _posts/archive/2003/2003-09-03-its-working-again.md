After I updated my [.Text](http://scottwater.com/dottext/) sources two day ago from the [official workspace](http://www.gotdotnet.com/Community/Workspaces/workspace.aspx?id=e99fccb3-1a8c-42b5-90ee-348f6b77c407), I wasn't able to post anymore, because some essential stored procedures were missing. Meanwhile, Scott has [updated the sources](http://scottwater.com/dottext/posts/9716.aspx). I'm back on-line.
