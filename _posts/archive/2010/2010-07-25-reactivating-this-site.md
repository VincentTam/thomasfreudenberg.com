Yes, this blog is still alive, though the last post is about two and a half years old.

It has happened a lot since then, but it can be condensed in two points: a) I moved again, this time to [Bernau am Chiemsee](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernau_am_Chiemsee) at the “other end” of Germany, and b) I got married. And the latter caused the former :-)

Anyway, after 30 month of silence I think I should reactivate this blog. In the past I hesitated because most of the time I thought my topics are too trivial to write about. But that’s because whenever I had a particular programming error, I thought about it and tried to solve it. But at the point of the solution I’m already so familiar with the problem that I think it’s not interesting enough anymore to blog about it.

But on the other hand, other might have had the same problem, so why not help them and publish a possible solution? At least Google will find it.

Additionally blogging will help me to sharpen my rusty English skills ;)

Anyway, in my profession and in my spare time I deal with WPF, IoC containers, ASP.NET MVC, NoSQL databases (RavenDB in particular) among others, so you know what to expect in the future.
