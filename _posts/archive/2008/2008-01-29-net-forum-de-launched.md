[![.NET Forum](/files/archive/dotnet-forum.gif)](http://dotnet-forum.de/)

A couple of days ago [Jan Welker](http://blog.jan-welker.de/) launched a new German .NET related community site, [.NET-Forum.de](http://dotnet-forum.de/). I didn't expect the developsphere to require just another site, but there are already 51 users registered, even though the site wasn't advertised anywhere except the [dotnet-snippets.de](http://dotnet-snippets.de) newsletter.

Jan set up Community Server 2007.1 to drive the site (Did you know that .NET related non-profit communities may receive [a free license](http://docs.communityserver.org/kb/article.aspx/160/i-am-a-net-user-group-or-not-for-profit-net-community-site-do-you-have-discounts-available/)?) I try to support Jan whenever he experiences issues with CS or has a configuration question. So for me it's an appreciated opportunity to get to learn CS's forum capabilities (Till now I only used the blogging part.)

I wish Jan success, and maybe this post will lead some more people to his site.
