Today I managed to update my site to [.Text .95](http://scottwater.com/blog/archive/2004/01/02/11058.aspx) by following [this guide](http://dottextwiki.scottwater.com/default.aspx/Dottext.ONinetyFiveUpgrade). It turned out all right, however, here's an advice for you: if you're using a custom skin, switch your blog back to a default one. ![Wink](/files/archive/smiley_dead.gif)

During the next couple of days I will customize the skin. Though the current one ([AnotherEon001](http://anothereon.net/weblog/posts/246.aspx) by [Christian Nordbakk](http://www.anothereon.net/weblog/)) is pretty nice, I don't like the rendering of the links on the left.
