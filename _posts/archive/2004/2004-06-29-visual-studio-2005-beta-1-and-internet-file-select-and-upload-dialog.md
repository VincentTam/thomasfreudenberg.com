\*Sigh\* You may have already read that today (06/29/2004) Visual Studio Beta 1 *should* be available to MSDN subscribers. I'm checking the [Subscriber Downloads](http://msdn.microsoft.com/subscriptions/resources/subdwnld.asp) pages now for several hours every now and then, but until now (17:47, or 5:47 PM for my American readers) it's still not listed there. I suppose it's not replicated yet to [Akamai](http://www.akamai.com/)'s servers in Europe (or at least in Germany).

In the meanwhile, I recommend you to have a look at [Daniel Fisher](http://www.lennybacon.com)'s [Internet File Select and Upload Dialog](http://www.staticdust.net/shop/product.aspx?Product=63). ([Announcement](http://www.dotnetgerman.com/blogs/lennybacon/Trackback.aspx?guid=a0d92b86-7b08-424c-b89b-9e1f19dd9ee8)) It's an ASP.NET component for uploading files to your server with a rich GUI.

**Update:** Daniel has added an [online demo](http://www.staticdust.net/samples/StaticDust.Web.UI.Controls.UploadDialog/).

**Update 2:** [Sam Gentile](http://samgentile.com/) [wrote](http://samgentile.com/blog/archive/2004/06/29/12027.aspx): *Visual Studio 2005 Beta 1 will be available in a few days to MSDN Subscribers.* \*sigh\*
