Microsoft'sÂ Patterns and Practices group has released its "[Improving .NET Application Performance and Scalability](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dnpag/html/scalenet.asp)" guide on MSDN. I also recommend reading [Rico Mariani's foreword](http://blogs.msdn.com/ricom/archive/2004/04/28/122503.aspx).

**Update:** Rico's foreword is included in the guide as well, so you don't have to follow the second link above.
