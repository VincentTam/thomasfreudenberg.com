Currently it's not possible to post comments on my blog. I'm still investigating this issue. I have a copy of all files and the database running at home, but I cannot reproduce this error. Somehow the files are rendered differently on my [WebHost4Life hosted](http://www.webhost4life.com/default.asp?refid=Thoemmi) blog, i.e. the form's `onsubmit` is rendered as `"if (!ValidatorOnSubmit()) return false;"` while everywhere else it is just `"ValidatorOnSubmit();"`.Â Any help is welcome.
