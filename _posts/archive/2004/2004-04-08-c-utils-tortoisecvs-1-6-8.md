With this post I'm starting a new category on my blog, *c:\\utils*. Its name is derived from [Scott Hanselman](http://www.hanselman.com/)'s [Ultimate Developer and Power Users Tools List](http://radio.weblogs.com/0106747/stories/2003/09/09/scottHanselmansUltimateDeveloperAndPowerUsersToolsList.html). However, I'm not going to post a complete list of tools I am using, instead I will post a small notice here whenever one of the utilities is updated.

Two days ago, [TortoiseCVS](http://www.tortoisecvs.org/) 1.6.8 has been released. Download available [here](http://www.tortoisecvs.org/download.shtml).

TortoiseCVS is a Windows Shell Extension, which integrates access to CVS into the shell, e.g. you can directly check out modules, update, commit and see differences by right clicking on files and folders within Explorer. I'm hardly using [WinCvs](http://www.wincvs.org) anymore, because TortoiseCVS gives you all atÂ your fingertips.
