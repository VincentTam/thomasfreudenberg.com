Finally I know what The Third Place means. Several month ago Sony started it advertising compaign for its [Playstation 2](http://www.playstation2.com/) here in Germany. Everytime the TV ads finishes with a child shouting *Playstation Two - The Third Place*. My girlfriend and I always wondered what this *Third Place* means. [Now we know](http://user.gru.net/domz/third.htm). Thanks to [Rory](http://neopoleon.com/blog/posts/2579.aspx) and [ChrisAn](http://www.simplegeek.com/permalink.aspx/2478547b-059c-4298-9006-b53b4666cfe9).
