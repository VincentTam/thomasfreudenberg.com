message: ya I agree those cyber squatters really suck big time. I would say they are shit, not even shit, a rotten piece of shit would be a better comparision. I am waiting for the day when cyber squatting will be made illegal. Some countries like vietnam already have effective laws against cyber squatting. In vietnam its illegal to sell or lease a domain. You can register it and us it but you can't resell. This rule should be applied world wide. This way cyber squatters cant ask fantasy prices for domains they are simply blocking anymore.
