  Man oh man oh man...where to begin! Good job for doing your homework first off, though I'm assuming you ended having to pay the $60...that's better than 1000, but still ridiculous IMO.



  While I prefer the non-hyphenated version, you now own them both, so set up some redirects from the - one, or see if you can get your money back :-).



  At the very least, you should feel honored that your name is worth cyber-squatting...you're worth a thousand bucks!
