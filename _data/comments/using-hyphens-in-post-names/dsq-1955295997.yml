  Quick question about this: How is other punctuation handled in the post title? i.e. I'd say more than half of my posts have formats like so:



  First part of the title -- second part



  or



  first part of the title...second part



  I'm the first to admit that I'm regex impaired...how would I go about stripping out all punctuation and still have the hyphens?



  Second question: Is there a way to get both formats running on the same installation? I wouldn't want to lose my old trackbacks with the default format.
