  Ok fantastic...I'll try and get this up and running.



  One more question for you (and forgive me if the answer is obvious)...how do you preserve whitespace in comments on your CS install? Comments on mine get all squished together (as you've seen from your code comment on my site). Very annoying and I gave up tracking it down months ago.
