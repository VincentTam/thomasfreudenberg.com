  I think the coco devs have been caught a little offguard by how much this is (and will continue to) take off, but they seem to be adapting nicely. I also requested another feature...support for CommentAPI enabled blogs. Shouldn't be too hard for them to hook into the CAPI pipeline and have our accounts automatically pinged when submitting comments from feed readers.



  So, who's gonna design a coco icon we can include in our comment form in the interim? Dave, I know you have some Photoshop experience!
