message: "The discs will be published very soon - keep an eye on the notification feed because I'll be putting out a special update of it as soon as the bits are live. We actually acquired the bits within an hour of their release, but it takes a bit of time for that much data to be fully replicated and ready for worldwide download.  \r\n\r\nAndy Boyd  \r\n\r\nProgram Manager  \r\n\r\nMSDN Subscriber Downloads  \r\n\r\nandboyd@nospam.microsoft.com"
