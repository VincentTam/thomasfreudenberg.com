message: I just saw "seperate" on a comment on a Flickr photo. It looked wrong to my eyes. To be sure, I asked my 17 year old son "how d'you spell separate?" , without placing undue emphasis on the "a' syllable. "s e p a r a t e", came the answer.I think people who have seen the word "desperate" may be the cause of the confusion?
