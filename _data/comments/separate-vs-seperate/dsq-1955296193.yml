  separate: to split into two etc. - the act



  seperate: two different things etc. - the result



  This is what I was taught in school.



  Unfortunately "Word" and other software products use American-English spelling and don't recognise (with and "-ise") a lot of British (true) English spelling. If English doesn't originate from England then where the f*ck does it? That's why they don't call it "Americanish". Egocentric America yet again thinks the World revolves around them!! BTW it's "mum" not "mom", "Usama" not "Osama", much the same "Obama" should be "Ubama" aka You Bummer!
