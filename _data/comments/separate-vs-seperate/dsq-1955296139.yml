  Additionally, there's nothing wrong with starting a sentence with because. Alot (which, incidentally, is another newly compounded word in the vein of "alright" that teachers stupidly frown upon) of BS rules were forced on me at an early age in school, and I quickly realized that teachers and etymologists didn't create the English language.



  We all did, we all do, and we all will (we being any fluent English-speaker, of which there are well over one billion). All of us as a whole are continually crafting this language we call English. The process is continual, and ever-changing. English from several centuries ago is now unreadable. Go look at Beowulf for example.



  More recent examples of English, such as Shakespeare's works, are still readable for a modern English-speaker, but doing so is awkward and difficult. English will continue to evolve, and very well may look much different 500 years from now.
