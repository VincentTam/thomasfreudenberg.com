  I abbreviate certain specific('pacific' works better for me) words, including Pls for Please, Txt for Text, Thru for... (take a wild guess... :o) ), Ditto Nite, Ewe for You, and now finally, the most space/time/ink/energy/wear and tear-saving inspired abbreviation of them all <deliberate pause="">, has to be....Woddy for What Do You (as in, 'Woddya want for fuck's sake?').



  So there.
