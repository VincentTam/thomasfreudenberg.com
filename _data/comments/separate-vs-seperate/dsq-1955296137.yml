  Anyone interested in etymology should be fully aware of the follies of linguistic prescriptivism and the fact that phonological, phonemic, spelling and semantic drift are all natural parts of the eternal process of language evolution, which has its roots in neurobiology and will not be stopped by technology or the implementation of rules.



  If words didn't change there would be no such thing as etymology.
