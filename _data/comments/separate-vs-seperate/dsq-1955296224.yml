  Why are you all even debating this? "Seperate" isn't in the dictionary so it isn't a word and it isn't just waiting around to be added, as it is a misspelling of the correct word. It's all apocryphal.



  I notice The Goat above who enjoys picking people's grammar apart doesn't use correct English either since troll isn't a verb it's a noun. He also omitted to use speech marks around the word "sepErate" which he should since it doesn't exist and if he is so concerned about the use of grammar he would've shocked his immature and narrow mind by his use of capitulation in the middle of a word. What a cunt.
