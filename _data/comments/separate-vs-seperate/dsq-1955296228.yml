message: "to TT, Australian (and any other british colony dwellers):\r\n\r\nRecognise vs Recognize\r\n\r\nEver see the word recognizant?  \r\nor the action Recognise?\r\n\r\nMerriam Websters Dictionary reports Recognise as 'especially british'.\r\n\r\nRecognize is the formal spelling, and i'll assume that British English adapted the word and it was not taken form old English.\r\n\r\n-ize taken from latin a suffix to mean action, to render or make. latin suffix  \r\n-ise british suffix meaning to organize?\r\n\r\nroot word: Latin: recognōscere  \r\nre- prefix meaning to do again?  \r\nCognate- means remember or take note\r\n\r\nRe- Cognate -ize   \r\n<remove -ate:=\"\" suffix=\"\" used=\"\" to=\"\" form=\"\" adjectives=\"\" and=\"\" nouns,=\"\" and=\"\" replace=\"\" with=\"\" suffix=\"\" to=\"\" act=\"\" -=\"\" ize.=\"\">\r\n\r\nOtherwise known as Recognize.\r\n\r\nSo TT wishes to bash an American for using a word that isnt like Britains, when we use the suffixes as they are supposed to be used, and they make up their own?\r\n\r\nrec·og·nize /ˈrɛkəgˌnaɪz/   \r\n[rek-uhg-nahyz]\r\n\r\n–verb (used with object), -nized, -niz·ing.   \r\n1. to identify as something or someone previously seen, known, etc.: He had changed so much that one could scarcely recognize him.   \r\n2. to identify from knowledge of appearance or characteristics: I recognized him from the description. They recognized him as a fraud.   \r\n3. to perceive as existing or true; realize: to be the first to recognize a fact.\r\n\r\nHowever I'll go so far as to say, I HAVE seen Recognise used correctly.\r\n\r\n-ise to organize.  \r\nRecognise= To organize Thoughts again.\r\n\r\nWhen Harry gave recognise, he realized he had forgotten that memory.\r\n\r\nHe decided to Rethink his thoughts... Catch the drift?\r\n\r\nDon't confuse the 2 terms by their suffixes.\r\n\r\nAnother similar:  \r\nOrganise vs Organize (British -ise at play again)\r\n\r\nSo the 'act' of arranging = Organ-ize  \r\n-ise means to organize so it can technically be interchanged because to organize an organize is to Organise? LOL <hits forehead=\"\" on=\"\" desk=\"\">\r\n\r\nSubtlties are mind blowingly funny. :)\r\n\r\nYet, I 'so' do love constructs of the Prefix and Suffix.\r\n\r\nEvery Word in the Language can be cut down into a root sub-word or multiple words, and each piece of the word has meaning.\r\n\r\nIf you want to bash American English, in favor of your own, let me interject.\r\n\r\nBritish define: Pissed = To get drunk?  \r\nAmericans define as = Royally angry... :)\r\n\r\nBobby is the name of a person, not the position of an officer! lol :P\r\n\r\nBut as for properly English spelling, I think I'll back the spelling which uses the proper Root words with the proper suffixes."
