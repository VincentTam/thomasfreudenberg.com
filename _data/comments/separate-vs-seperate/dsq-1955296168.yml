message: "This has been something that has bugged me for awhile too.  \r\nI'm seeing seperate identified as a misspelling by some posters.  \r\nMy father was career English teacher and so was I.   \r\nI was taught the difference between seperate and separate in school (60's & 70's). They were definitely two different words with distinct spellings (as Misinformed stated). 'Separate' became the lone spelling sometime in 80's and 'seperate' started being listed as an \"archaic\" spelling. So now 'separate' covers both meanings. It really annoyed me for awhile because I had always been so careful to use the correct spelling for each of the two meanings. A few years ago I finally caved and started using 'separate' exclusively"
