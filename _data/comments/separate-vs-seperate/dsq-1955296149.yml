  While it is true that "plough" has changed into "plow," "draught," and "drought" mean two different things, at least in modern American English. A draught is a drink, usually a liquor or medicinal drink. In British English, it is in the same family as "draft" and "drafty." A drought is a dry period. As is evidenced by the red dotted line beneath "draught" in this window, Firefox does recognize the word, while Word does. This is because "draught" is not a commonly used word today. It may disappear completely in the coming years.



  What will happen if, as another commenter suggested, "through becomes "thru," and "night" becomes "nite?" I don't believe that is a wise path. Although I support natural linguistic evolution, I do not support stupidity. "All right" was a natural choice for conversion from phrase to compound word, and "alright" is now widely accepted. Hopefully "a lot" will enjoy acceptance as a "alot" on the same level someday, but I guess it doesn't really matter since "alot" is already in widespread use.



  But what about "thru" and "nite?" I don't like the commercial origins and implications of those words. They, and many other such words in use today, echo eerily with Newspeak, Orwell's fictional oversimplification of the English language, which was intentionally engineered to destroy the ability to articulate philosophical and creative concepts, as well as the ability to voice dissent. Newspeak made liberal use of atrocious words such as "gooder," and doubleplusgood." I personally don't want to see language go down that path, for aesthetic as well as cultural concerns.
