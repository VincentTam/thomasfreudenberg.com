message: "This appears to be another of the UK/US divisors.\r\n\r\nI actually went to my attic and found my old case of school papers and my old school dictionary (pack rat -- sue me)\r\n\r\nIn the UK, we were taught that there were two different words. SepArate, a verb: \"We need to separate those rabbits\"  \r\nand SepErate, a noun: \"We now keep the rabbits in seperate pens\"\r\n\r\nAs they provide distinctly different information, they are perfectly valid -- as long as people continue to agree with those meanings."
