message: "LOL ..I agree MikeC..better things to do but this was kinda interesting..  \r\n**Justabrowser** -- started the etymology thread, forgot to include the gaelic and french influences on our language. ALso forgot to point out that part of the etymology of the English laguage IS Shakespeare, meaning, when he needed a new word, he 'made it up'..true he was a linguist and followed rules in his word-making, but make em up he did. Language is living, does evolve and change..BUT adding words to a dictionary because people can't be bothered to spell them right is wrong..spelling suggests..ahh never mind, ..  \r\n\"The English language had deteriorated into a hybrid of hillbilly, valleygirl, inner-city slang and various grunts.\"..[but someone who speaks proper English (non-Ameicanized) sounds,] \"..pompous and faggy to them.\"  \r\nAHHH..maybe THAT is the answer,,Separate the forms of English..American English and Proper English .. I mean the way I see it, Americans took the English language, dropped the accent, bastardized many words, and continue to steal and bastardize words from many other languages.   \r\nCroissant is NOT cresent, pat√© is NOT pate, sauna is NOT sawNa (it IS **s-ou[as in sour]-na**)---whats really funny is look up sour in a dictionary ([http://www.merriam-webster....](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/sour) \"http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/sour)\") and the suggested pronounciation of the ou sound is described using au... just goes to show, even if ya spell it right, doesn't mean they will say it correct.\r\n\r\n\"'Comin' up next on The Violence Channel: An all-new 'Ow, My Balls!'\" ...  \r\n\"The years passed, mankind became stupider at a frightening rate. Some had high hopes the genetic engineering would correct this trend in evolution, but sadly the greatest minds and resources where focused on conquering hair loss and prolonging erections. \"  \r\n--(quotes from 'Idiocracy')"
