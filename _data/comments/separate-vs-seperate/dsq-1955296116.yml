message: "I disagree with those who think that language rules are a matter of mass usage and nothing else.\r\n\r\nEtymology: Middle English, from Latin separatus, past participle of separare, from se- apart + parare to prepare, procure â€” more at secede, pare   \r\nDate: 15th century\r\n\r\nFrom the original Latin separatus, we evolve to the modern separate. English is based on Latin, Germanic, Greek, and some Cyrillic and Arabic. As a living language, many influences have and continue to influence its evolution. However, separatus has never been spelled seperatus. Whenever there is a question as to how a word should be spelled, we can always look to the etymology for guidance. Without rules, chaos exists. There would be no need to teach etymology and ancient roots of language if rules didn't matter. Uneducated people are the only ones who will state that \"whatever people do the most prevails\". What nonsense. What's next? Redefinition of the words? They mean whatever most people statistically say they mean? Pizza means hamburger now because everyone accepts it? Bullshit."
