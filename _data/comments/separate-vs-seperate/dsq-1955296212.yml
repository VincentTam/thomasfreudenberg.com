  I've just put my house on the market.



  Amongst other things it's got a kitchen with separate utility room. The ad went on the internet. I was annoyed to spot three spelling mistakes the agent had made, including the "seperate" room. I phoned them up and explained, even spelling it for them. They corrected it that afternoon. It then read "Kitchen with seprate utility"!!



  FFS! I rang them today, and spelled it again.



  I checked just now.



  "Kitchen with seperate utility"



  I give up!
