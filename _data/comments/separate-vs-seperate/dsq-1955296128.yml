message: "I'm also guilty of misspelling that one. But I just realized something reading the posts and working on photoshop with this word...\r\n\r\nMany people suggested that \"seperate\" looks better. Visually it does, I agree, from design perspective the \"e\" flows much more smoothly to the \"t\" -- makes a tidy composition. The shape of the \"a\" in between the \"p\" and the \"t\" causes a brief pause; which coincidentally makes conceptual sense considering the meaning of the word.\r\n\r\nJust wondering... maybe the common misspelling of this word also has something to the with the Gestalt factor.  \r\nAnyway, I'll probably remember to spell it right from now on :)"
