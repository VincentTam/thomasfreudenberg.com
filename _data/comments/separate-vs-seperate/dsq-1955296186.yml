  "Separate (Verb) - to unjoin, to divide



  Seperate (Noun) - unjoined, not united"



  I think you'll find "Separate" is never a noun (name of an object, place, person or idea), and never spelled with an "E"; it can be a verb (the act of separating eggs, for instance) or an ADJECTIVE as it DESCRIBES the state of two objects or ideas. No dictionary will ever contain the word "Seperate"



  I'm 21, English, and have access to an actual dictionary. Maybe I take too much pride in my heritage for someone of my age, considering the extent to which I care about correct use of the language I was brought up with. However, if generations upon generations of indifference to these abominations are allowed then we may end up with a language that is comprised of more acronyms, abbreviations and misplaced apostrophes than a drunken lowlife's latest text message about their newest "ASBO".
