message: who cares about spelling (" intellectual snobbery has never been more prevalent amongst those who rally around an isolated idea of mental superiority clearly furnished through privileged education")...is perfect grammar and tonality key to obtaining validity?... [ in my mind this sheds light on an egocentric focus on our self presentation ... the modern youth as far as i can see is soo "advanced" as too believe that spelling and grammer are insight into a persons intellect... how terribly confining... To me the most enchanting thing about the intellect is that it is not contained by expectation or presentation despite our efforts.. it really is the true measure our potential always shocking even us in it's exprsesivity
