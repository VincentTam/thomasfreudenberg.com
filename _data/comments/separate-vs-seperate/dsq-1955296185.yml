message: "The way we speak and the overall use of language just get's worse and worse.\r\n\r\nPeople using abbreveations such as BTW or OMG. The constant use of the word 'literally' when a lot of the time they actually mean 'figuratively'.\r\n\r\nAnd what is it with 'At the end of the day'?\r\n\r\nWhat is happening at the end of the day, can anybody tell me? It seems that there is a lot happening at the end of the day.\r\n\r\nIn my own personal opinion, I feel that people are dumbing down; the use of SMS on mobile phones and generally writing or spelling words how they hear them.   \r\nFar be it from me to demand that we all become Thespians, but a bit more care should be taken when we speak and/or write.\r\n\r\nIf not just out of Courtesy.\r\n\r\nRant over..."
