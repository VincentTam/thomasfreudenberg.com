message: Good god, there are people here arguing for separate who go on to spell recognise with a 'z'! Bloody daft yanks, your whole culture is a result of poorly remembered English culture, like someone forgot all the rules to rugby except for the shape of the ball - ship rats escaping poverty who lacked education playing chinese whispers with language and culture. And you claim to be English speaking, you give English a bad name.... :D
