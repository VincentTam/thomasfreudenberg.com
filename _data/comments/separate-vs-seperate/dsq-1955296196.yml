  In my locality (Western Canada), most people have very different pronounciations for the verb and the adjective; why should they even be the same word?



  And I do believe that many years ago I was taught that they were seperate words. Maybe at some point in history people separated them, and now there is a movement to unseparate them!



  Actually, I think that in this case there are good arguments on both sides, so I wouldn't want to voice any strong opinion.



  But these things do matter. I am just publishing a computer API that contains that word, so the thousands of people who write computer software using it will be forced to use the spelling I choose, or it won't work for them. Which is why I'm here reading everyone's comments. Right now, I am leaning towards "separate", mainly because Google shows that to be much more popular.
