  I think seperate should become a word, with a distinct meaning than separate. Separate would be the verb, seperate the adjective.



  Just because the status quo (the dictionary) states one thing does not mean it needs to stay that way forever. If that were the case we would not even be using stone tools yet or cooking our food. Hell, life would not exist. Evolution (of words, life and everything) is perfectly natural. Preferably evolution in a forward direction ;
