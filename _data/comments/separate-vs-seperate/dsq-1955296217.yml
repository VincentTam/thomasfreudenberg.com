message: "Well, that was fascinating reading. I also arrived here because I was sure I'd been taught both spellings, yet all I could find in Word, Google, etc was separate.\r\n\r\nAfter reading *all* the posts (something it appears some of the posters haven't done), my memories are confirmed.\r\n\r\nIn school (Australia, circa 70s) I was taught :\r\n\r\n\"Separate the rabbits\"  \r\n\"The rabbits are seperate\"\r\n\r\nIt appears others were also taught this.  \r\nIt also appears that this may have been etymologically incorrect.\r\n\r\nDoes this mean the use of \"seperate\" came *into* use sometime prior to 1970, and was originally not actually a word? I've been unable to determine this, but it seems likely based on what I've read.\r\n\r\nNow, it appears this spelling has fallen out of use.\r\n\r\nSo in summary :\r\n\r\nSeperate, while probably etymologically incorrect, was actually a word, at least in Australia, as it was taught in schools (note the plural) and was presumably in the dictionaries of that time.\r\n\r\nNow, it appears to be an \"archaic\" word.\r\n\r\nSucks that I'm old enough to be using what could be desribed as \"old English\" LOL."
