message: "This was entertaining, and thought provoking. Thought this might add to the entertainment factor: These are some quips from an email called \"Southern Facts - Things I Have Learned in the South\". I've only included the parts that have to do with pronunciations:\r\n\r\n • Onced and Twiced are words.   \r\n • Jaw-P? means Did y'all go to the bathroom?   \r\n • Fixinto is 1 word. It means I'm fixing to do that.  \r\n • There is no such thing as lunch. There is only dinner and then there is supper.  \r\n • Backards and forards means I know everything about you.  \r\n • The word jeet is actually a phrase meaning, Did you eat?  \r\n • You dont PUSH buttons, you MASH em.  \r\n • You know what a hissy fit is."
