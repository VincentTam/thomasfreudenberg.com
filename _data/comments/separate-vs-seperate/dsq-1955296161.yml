  TT: you may want to study up on the history of English culture- YOUR fabulous culture- which is the result of quite a mishmash of different peoples immigrating to the British isles. Golly, it's almost like how the United States' culture came to be!



  Implying that American culture is based entirely on British culture is absurd and ethnocentric to the extreme. You should educate yourself before you call others "daft".



  Oh and one more thing- you're an ass.
