message: "Hm, this is quite interesting because my whole life I thought \"separate\" was spelled \"seperate\".  \r\nIt actually confused me because there's so many words spelled differently in other countries, and well since I'm Canadian, but use American made computer software, a lot of my words are supposedly spelled wrong including \"separate\", so I'm actually just unsure if \"seperate\" is a Canadian variation or not.\r\n\r\nI've also read that most people will be able to fluently read most text where all the letters are scrambled in each word as long as the first letter and the last letter of each word are in their proper place. Which is probably why it's so easy to read intentional (such as improper contractions and compounds) and unintentional misspellings and such. If the spelling \"seperate\" is not the cause of being a variation used in the area spoken/written, I imagine that what I stated earlier is to blame."
