message: The fact that Word or other programs doesn't recognize "seperate" or "seperete" is irrelevant. Yes, those spellings are incorrect, but Word and other programs fail to recognize droves of scientific words and neologisms as well. Word processors and dictionaries can never be complete in this day and age, due to the fact that as science and technology advance, new words are constantly being coined for both general use and in various specialized communities.
