  I can't help but laugh (laf) at all of the people who have commented here. Out of the dozens of posts, a handful are actually grammatically sound. Out of those there are maybe half as much that use proper spelling. I like to complain, but don't be a hypocrite!



  You cannot sepErate yourself from the rest of the intellectually disabled people if you cannot even form a proper sentence. I am, also, horrifically guilty of misspelling this word until my girlfriend pointed it out in an argument one time.



  (Just here to troll the people who can't seem to figure out what they're actually complaining about)
