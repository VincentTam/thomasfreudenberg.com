message: Seperate was a word and if you rely on Microsoft word for your spell check I guess colour isn't a word either..=)..I understand people are lazy and don't want to confuse things or learn proper usage of the language they speak but I learnt it in school along with the difference between practice and practise and don't understand what is so difficult about it..I mean they are two different words and describe and do different things so shouldn't they be spelt differently? I apparently have five words with red lines underneath and yet nothing is wrong but this is probably an american english, oh and apparently I need to capitalize American and English otherwise they are incorrect..haha
