message: hahaha. i agree with everyone. i dont think the spelling looks all that correct when its "separate" but as the smart person said "etymology" is a big part of language. and also i dont think we should be having this dispute over the miss spelling of a word,it's rather idiotic. and nice analogy about the pizza and burgers. hah.
