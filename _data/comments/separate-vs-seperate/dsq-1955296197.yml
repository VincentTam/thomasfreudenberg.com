  It's not the Brits - it's the Americans who are ruining the english language! Wadermelon?! Really?! That might be the way you say it, but it doesn't necessarily mean that it's right.



  The amount of times I've seen "recognize" in these posts too, proves the point. I think that's wrong. In Australia we spell it "recognise". Just because Microsoft Word doesn't know recognise, doesn't mean that it's wrong....



  However, I do agree that the word is separate and not seperate. It doesn't even matter what the meaning is, but we say it in different ways. Eg. X is separate from Y (pronounced "seprat") or I need to separate X from Y (pronounced "seperate"). That's how you know the difference!



  Have fun arguing everyone! :-)
