  New and simpler spellings are always being introduced. We use "plow" for "plough" now, and eventually we'll probably use "thru" for "through" and "nite" for "night". British English still spells a lot of words the traditional way, like "draught"... but most Americans looking at that word would think it says "drought" (because we're used to seeing "draft" instead of "draught").



  The definitive Correct Spelling is whatever's in the dictionary, and that is mostly a matter of whatever people in your area are using.
