message: Indeed, it has to be one of the most annoying things in the world, when a word you have used all of your life is somehow misspelled then just added willy-nilly to a dictionary just because someone could not be bothered to correct the mistake. It's just sad, that with the advent of personal computers, and software having spell checking built in, that people can't even be bothered to click a button to make sure it's all good before making a fool of themselves.
