  Well, I suppose in a few years it won't matter anyway, whether it's separate or seperate. The world adds new words to the dictionary all the time. Granted it may not be in there now, but if a whole bunch of people just start spelling it that way and keep spelling it that way, then it'll be acknowledged as a different way of spelling separate.



  Personally, I think it just depends on how you talk or where you come from. If you sound it out as "separate" when you talk, then that's how you probably spell it. If you sound it out as "seperate" when you talk, then that's how you're going to spell it.
