message: "Kev...\r\n\r\nI have looked for any dictionary or educational site in Australia using hte 'Seperate' spelling and find none. You said \"presumably in the dictionaries of that time\". If it was ever in the dictionary, it would still be in the dictionary.\r\n\r\nEither your teacher was wrong, and didnt correct her/himself, or noone ever openned the dictionary to gleam it's wisdom.\r\n\r\nMr Goat:  \r\nPlease... For the Love of all that is Holy and Just... Please STOP using abbreviated sentences. You only lower your socially presumed IQ.\r\n\r\nFor All:   \r\nThere is nothing to argue. Trying to change the spelling of a Schwa E, from an 'a' to an 'e' will only do you harm. ;)\r\n\r\nBah... I mistyped the Schwa myself. It's a 'uh' sounds... My ears are partly deaf, so I hear things funny anyway. -eh... -uh... whats the difference. :P LOL"
