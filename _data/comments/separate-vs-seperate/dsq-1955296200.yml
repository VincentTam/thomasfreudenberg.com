message: "Separate vs. semper seperate? I think it is the same as aluminum vs. aluminium, or Kanji vs. Kana. Some folks understand etymology and are educated, some are not. It helps that they remain identifiable. It is like an insider code. You either know what a word means in depth, it's history, etc.. That is very important in English because it is a language deriving meaning from nuances expressed in single words. Or ... you live your live by appearance only: how \"seperate\" (not even defined as a word yet!) \"looks better\" and your fellow beings with mediocre codebooks (ciphers) chime in with cheer ...  \r\nMr. Freudenberg, may I suggest a quote from Schiller for you: \"Against stupidity even the gods contend in vain.\" (although I have seen that quote also attributed to Greek philosophy before)\r\n\r\nKeep your codebook ready and know who your friends are, those who can spell maybe? At several million Google hits for seperate, it is a new American word \"creation\" now, although it has no meaning nor is it simpler than the original form, it is just etymological noise. (semper=always btw.)"
