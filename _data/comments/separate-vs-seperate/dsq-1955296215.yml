  Idiots from Microsoft wrote this function name:



  "SplitIntoSeperateTriangles()"



  Being a native Spanish speaker developer, who never speaks English, I don't know if I should laugh, or cry, or ask for a job in Microsoft in place of that damn asshole who wrote the sample, which is too unclear, misspelled and I even think he may be the same idiot that documented "Write()" as a function "for reading".



  This is because people who don't really care about doing things right, they just want to get paid and go home to continue their mindless lives, instead to trying to improve themselves, their education, etc. They don't pay attention when reading their own language read and spoken everyday. They suck. I spelled better English when I was 13, even programmed too, and I think those people is who then sell their own country and life and children because they think they already know everything when they can barely speak their own language.



  So, if you don't want to look like an idiot in front of educated people, then spell SEPARATE, please, or tomorrow I may end up taking your job, and I'm going to enjoy it so much, so much.
