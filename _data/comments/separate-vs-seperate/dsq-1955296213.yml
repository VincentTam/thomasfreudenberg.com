message: Seperate was probably started in the South...where poeple talk with a slang accent, and spell things like they pronounce it. "Hey Ya'll git yer gun! We gonna go kill sumthin" " See what I mean! LOL!! But seperate is a misspelling and is wrong. It is not a word, or a replacement. And there is no sich thing as NEW version! Duh!
