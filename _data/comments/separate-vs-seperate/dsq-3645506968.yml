message: "Omg .. since when does how a word is pronounced dictate its spelling? Especially in English.   \r\nMy head is reeling with the visual of people re-correcting it to 'seperate' after autocorrect has altered it to its correct spelling.  \r\nYou folks will do anything to get out of learning correct spellings.\r\n\r\nYou can't just change the spelling of words to suit your fancy. \"SEPARATE\" come from TWO Latin words: 'Se' and 'papare' or 'paro'.. NOT.. pEpare or pEro... do you understand how that totally changes the meaning? Every. Single. Letter. Counts. Oh, and someone would have to prove to me that brits use \"seperate\" because first, I don't believe it, and second, if Brits do spell it that way, it is they and not Americans who are bastardizing the language which in the case of this word HAS ITS ROOTS IN LATIN."
