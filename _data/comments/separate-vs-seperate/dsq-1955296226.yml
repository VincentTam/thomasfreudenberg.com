message: "There is a misuse of verbage, that is dreadfully wrong in society. People become apt to misuse words, they become lazy, and/or uneducated. Thus, they tend to drift because they are blazingly lazy.\r\n\r\nSure, words drift. Gay means happy, yet one day you wake up and it's a term used for homosexuals? A stick was a small shaft of wood, which became a short-term abbreviated saying for a Funny man (slapstick) and boring individuals (stick-in-the-mud).\r\n\r\nAstral Symphony proves my point.\r\n\r\nDraught= A braft of Beer. Formed form the old-english word 'Dragen'. Developed into related words. Before this time period, they didnt have beer on draft, so there existed no words to describe the terms. Thus, words morphed to adapt terms to describe. So Dragen became: Drag, Draw, Draught... etc.\r\n\r\nDrought=An EXTENDED period of time with below average preceipitation. Derived from the old-english word 'drūgath'. Dry and dryness. There is a Archaic use of the term, to mean THIRSTY. Going a long period without drink. Duh?\r\n\r\nSo While a Draught is a Mug of Beer taken from a Tap. Going without Beer for a long time is living in a Drought.\r\n\r\nPlease do not confuse the terms. This leads to a language disambiguity.\r\n\r\nSerparate vs Seperate= History is made on the language which superseeded, and the derivation of words has morphed words to fill in the blanks that some words were used to umbrella the whole concept. Greek, Latin, Old English... They all had words which of themselves could cover a dozen concepts in 1 word. This is confusing to those who live in the future(from that timeperiod), because the definitions are often strained and ambiguous. Look at the Bible and the arguements about the ancient words used, and the flexible nature of the words... causing such confusion?\r\n\r\nEtymology of a word, often gives a new prospective on a use of a Term.\r\n\r\nLack of stict education, and laziness leads to disambiguity and the misuse of derived words. Changing a word to sound better... NO! Try pronouncing the word properly. When words are derived from an ancient source and travel thru a different country, the words absorb into their language. So while Old English and Middle English might have similar words that derived from a similar root word, they were spoken differently. Then English absorbed the words differently. You can see this in the difference between British English vs American English. British often take their derived words from Old English. Not the same for American English which has absorbed words from MANY cultures. Thus we pronounce words in Germanic, Spanish or other cultural ways. Look at the word Route and Router.\r\n\r\nRoute: A road or travel path.  \r\nSome pronounce this as \"Root\" as in the song \"Route 66\" (Root 66).  \r\nThe proper derived pronunciation is \"R-ow-t\" as in 'Trade Route'.  \r\nA IT guy uses a 'Router' to network computers. (R-ow-ter)\r\n\r\nWhich is correct? Commonly English says that -ou is an 'ow' sound, correct? But English Route is taken from the middle-english (Germanic) word Route. Middle English pronounces -ou the same way.. the -u sound as in my Grandpa's last name 'Lutringer' is pronounced L-oo-t-ringer.\r\n\r\nNow let's look at the Merriam websters dictionary. They say that Route is pronounced with a ü, which is the same lettering in my Grandpa's name?!? What is this? Route is a oo sound. R-oo-te? Ahh the derivation of this word comes from the Vulgar Latin word 'Rupta', Thus presenting why the British and Americans pronounce Route differently and how words similar to this dual derived word can confused the utter nonsense out of anyone learning the English language. Multiple root languages blended, makes it harder to learn.\r\n\r\nBack to Separate.\r\n\r\nHas anyone seen \"Bill and ted's excellent adventure\"? Did you pay attention to Socrates when he said his name? We commonly say \"Sock-ra-tees\" when we pronounce it. Socrates kept fixing the boys pronunciation to \"So-Kra-Tees\".\r\n\r\nBut what does this have to do with Separate?\r\n\r\nIt derives from the Latin 'separatus'past participle of 'separare'. Think Socrates.. \"Se-Pah-raht\". Anyone remember their \"Schwa\" E's in school?  \r\nSeparate: ˈse-p(ə-)ˌrāt\r\n\r\nThus the confusion from ESL's as they flounder on the strange symbol and think a Schwa ə- just sounds wrong as an A, but in fact... it is an 'a'.\r\n\r\nSeparate is mispronounced \"Se-peh-raht\", leading people to forget how to spell it, as the educators who taught them 'FAILED' miserably to teach elocution and proper verbal usage.\r\n\r\nAfter reading this, I hope you glimmered something about a language. It is true that if education slips and we allow the youth to 'typo' their way into the future, the English language is bound to drift into 'L33t' speak or we allow 'text' ghetto spelling to become common redefined spellings for words that used to have a proper derivation. If you change a words spelling, it looses it's connection to the word that spawned it.\r\n\r\nse-p(ə-)ˌrāt\r\n\r\nSay-Peh-Raht\r\n\r\nBTW... if there were teachers teaching 'seperate' in Australia. They were wrong. There is no Older way of spelling 'Seperate' and no derivation for the word. Thus, it is akin to Australia teaching Ebonics as a social accepted verbal redefinition of the whole English language... which I saw someone was attempting to do. :P\r\n\r\nPS. No I am NOT an English Major. I just paid attention in school. :P"
