message: "Early in this thread someone was convinced that seperate was not a word as it was not recognised by Word or Spell. That was because they are American programs and the USA has a lot of different spellings to the English. The discussion above about the two spellings relating to different meanings of the word is correct, and of course, they are pronounced differently.  \r\nThe second spelling has not been added to a dictionary because of common use. Both words have been there since heaven knows when."
