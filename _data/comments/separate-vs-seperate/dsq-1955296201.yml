message: "Can anyone provide a single reputable dictionary/usage-guide/source of educational material that suggests \"seperate\" was ever acceptable as the adjectival form? Given most of the people here who have suggested they were taught the 'e' form is a \"noun\" (er, what?) I'm not exactly rushing to put a whole lot of faith in their memories.\r\n\r\nWRT plough/plow and other cases of spelling changes in the language that have become acceptable, I think it's worth pointing that these generally have the obvious advantage of simplifying the language. \"Seperate\" does not.   \r\nIt no better relects the pronunciation than \"separate\", given that as an adjective the middle vowel typically isn't pronounced at all, and as a verb, the middle vowel is a schwa, which can be represented by almost any vowel (e.g. exhilarate, aspirate, decorate, saturate - although here the 'u' does change the 't' to a 'ch' sound, it's still a schwa vowel for most native speakers)."
