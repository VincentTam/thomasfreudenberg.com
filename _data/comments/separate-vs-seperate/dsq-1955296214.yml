message: "Yet another case of the yanks ruining our treasured english language, and going by the rule of Microsoft and Google. Who the hell gives a toss what they say, they're american aren't they? If we want it altered, we'll do it thanks!  \r\nThose who advocate this 'I use seperate as the verb, and separate as the the noun' are of course correct. Always have been and always will be. We didn't waste our time going to some of the best schools in England to be told how to use our own language by a bunch of americans. The dumbing down of the dictionaries came about once the publishers were lured by the evil that is the spell-checking programme (and that's spelt correctly as well)!"
