  Oh My! I, too, ended up on this page attempting to verify the correct spelling. Unfortunately, I verified that I was correct! (see below). However, I let the missive I was constructing languish while I perused this fascinating and strangely compelling debate. I decided that my email - telling the shift supervisor that the strange alarm in question meant he had better check on the device that separates radioactive waste from the river discharge water - could wait. Our entire language is at stake. But, seriously - I'm kidding.



  This is one of those few words that I know I spell wrong, every time, so I check them, every time. Alas, I must be capable of some learning reform, because this time I got it right, by myself. I cannot separate my feeling of accomplishment, from my feeling of once again being waylaid by the internet. Yes, I do use a spell checker, but only after I am done writing. I feel if I do not put forth the effort to learn how to do it right in the first place, I will be dependant on a crutch for the rest of my journey. - But, I DO cheat on the words I know I cannot spell.



  Thank you everyone for this brief, interesting, side-trip during my daily grind.
