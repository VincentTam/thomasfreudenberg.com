message: If I say "SepArate these two items." I pronounce the word the way I spell it, sep-A-rate. If I then say "These two items are in separate catagories.", I pronounce it sep-Er-at. This is probably part of the cause of the spelling confusion. Some people are despErate to justify their misspellings.
