message: I just found out that "seperate" is not in the dictionary any more, that it is "separate" only now...but it used to be that "seperate" and "separate" were two different words...one an adjective and one a verb. For example, "we went our seperate ways", we decided to "separate". I can't believe they took it out...I am befuddled...and online for confirmation...yep it's true.
