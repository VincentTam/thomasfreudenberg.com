Scott probably realized this and is why he's working on CS.  \r\n\r\nPersonally I can't mod my blog because it's hosted elsewhere. The customization options in .Text simply just aren't there compared to other CMS systems (when you get down to it a blog is a stripped CMS). So either .Text needs to be expanded or something else needs to come in to fill the plugin/skin void. We all want to personalize what we use but I can't do that at all right now. I'd love to introduce some SQL triggers and possibly fix up what's broken in our version but I just don't have that access.   \r\n\r\nHopefully Scott has little of .Text in CS::Blogs so he could be able to simply \"let go\" of .Text for the public at large. The only problem would be it would directly rival CS::Blogs so I don't think his employer would like that too much especially if they paid him money for the technology. Those of us who care may be left with developing a .Text clone to keep the hope alive. Personally I don't think I could choose anything other than .Text. It's good enough, though not perfect, for everything I need in a blogging engine today. Tomorrow? Who knows but it's all I need right now."
