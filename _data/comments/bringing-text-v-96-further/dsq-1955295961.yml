message: "Hi Thomas  \r\n\r\nGreat post. I completely agree with you on every point. There are some fantastic modifications out there for .Text but many of them require a rebuild of the source and I'm no coder, so there are hard if not impossible to implement. I would love to upgrade my version of .Text to 0.96 but its look like its out of my hands - even with Dave Burke's instructions. In fact without Bob Roudebush MyBookShelf and MyCDPlayer add-ons my site would look a little too thin. For this reason I'm getting back into C# in a big way and taking my very first steps in looking at the .Text source and trying to figure out how I can implement the new features that I want. However I'm keeping a really close eye on CS:Blogs to see what direction that takes *grin* and whether it will be right for me.  \r\n\r\nKind Regards  \r\n\r\nGary"
