message: "I too find it very educational and useful to see other, sometimes better, approaches to coding styles and challenges... My open source experience has made me a much better coder. The reason I blog, is to give back to that community, as well as to organize my thoughts (kind of like an engineering logbook). I chose .Text because I didn't want to take the time to make my own blog engine from scratch, and it came with the source, so when I wanted to make a change, I was only limited by my own time, energy and knowledge. It is an added bonus that there are other developers out there using the same blog structure out there, but really once you start to customize there is nothing too easy about sharing code. What has really kept me from going hard core into mods, is the promise of community server... I am looking to be able to better monitor my site, add things like ATOM, Podcasting, Inline Content editing, Maybe even a browser plugin for a \"Blog about this on my site\" button. I also think that .Text could be stripped down into a couple of modules for DNN, there has been a lot of talk about this, but I have not seen any results as of yet.. I too just run the systems in parallel with an identical skin. Of course I am also a bit busy, and don't have time to make my changes work in everyone else's environment or special case, which has been my most difficult challenge to date (to try to give back as much as I take =)...  \r\n\r\nDan"
