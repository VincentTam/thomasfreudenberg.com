message: "Gosh, lots to think about in this topic. I wanted to mention first, however, that the excellent work you've been doing with .text motivates guys like me to keep hacking away.   \r\n\r\nFor me, .text modification is more about the process of coding within ScottW's .text architecture than it is just building cool blog features for their own sake. As a minor point of clarification, I don't think I ever specifically asked for any one's source mods. They're wonderful to study and glean good stuff from, but I like to get in there myself and get deep, deep, deep (aka Eddie Murphy in Beverly Hills Copy) into .text and Scott's Code Brain. (That said, I definitely want to check out DonXML's trackback/pingback mods at [http://donxml.com/allthingstechie/archive/2005/01/25/1749.aspx](http://donxml.com/allthingstechie/archive/2005/01/25/1749.aspx \"http://donxml.com/allthingstechie/archive/2005/01/25/1749.aspx\")!)  \r\n\r\nI also want to plug Jason Alexander's nGallery application as a great learning vehicle and all-around great app! At my blog I integrated DotNetNuke, nGallery, and .Text for basic authentication and with common CSS styleguides across the apps, and I definitely want to continue to maintain all three in my site approach. So even though I totally agree with your sentiments on a big ol' Community Server app (how many guys need a forum module, anyway?), there is more coding I want to do in integrating DNN and nGallery into my .text experience. Top of the list is a component in admin\\EditPosts.cs to generate a row of images from selected nGallery pics when posting a blog. It would automatically generate the HTML and would appear on the blog like in my iPod and Dog series posts: [http://dbvt.com/blog/series/19.aspx](http://dbvt.com/blog/series/19.aspx \"http://dbvt.com/blog/series/19.aspx\") What motivates me to build that component would be, yes, to save time when inserting images, but also to give me the opportunity to work with Jason's Code Brain, which, like Scott's, is pretty darn big.  \r\n\r\nGuess I'm a loner that likes the virtual companionship of developers who are better than me. Man, the work day's getting away from me. I better get back to some of that loner coding action!  \r\n\r\nI'll definitely be tracking this topic. Thanks for posting and getting the discussion started.  "
