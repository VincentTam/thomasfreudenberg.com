message: "I think your goal to extend .text features for non-coders to use is very commendable. For good or bad, (and this is no knock on my friend and fellow Jason and the Argonauts appreciator, Gary) I never once considered non-coders as beneficiaries of the .text coding I'm doing. Guys like you and Dennis are more altruistic than I am, I guess.   \r\n\r\nI think Dan Bartels described the developerâ€™s position very clearly, as you did in your follow-up post, regarding the benefits of working with Open Source .text and the difficulties in sharing those changes with others.   \r\n\r\nA .Text Mod library or repository (or whatever) on the surface sounds reasonable, but after a second look its quite unworkable. Dan touched on this point. A modification to, say, support podcasting (not a good example, since its a lesser-extensive mod) can extend across .text projects, biz objects, database, etc which makes tracking those changes/additions, documenting and packaging them for sharing a time-consuming task for the developer. .Text mods are rarely if ever plug-n-play as you know.  \r\n\r\nI am proposing we embrace the virtual .Text mod library which already extends across the blogosphere in the form of a .Text Developers Mod Circle, where we who are doing .text mods can communicate with one another, build relationships with one another, get ideas and possibly bits of source to enhance our own work.   \r\n\r\nI personally want to put more mod packages online, but I want to know whose accessing them for the relationship factor--as corny as that might sound. I also want to collect basic stats on how many times a .text mod package is downloaded. Just because.   \r\n\r\nIâ€™m giving a presentation on Customizing .Text at the upcoming Code Camp III in Waltham, MA in March, and as a working code sample I plan on providing a package for supporting podcasting, only because thatâ€™s such a popular feature at the moment. Iâ€™ll see how that goes. I should have a simple mod package download component online before the conference to record basic stats and possibly some mod packages online by then, too. But then again, if putting the packages together takes too much time away from .text coding I doubt I'll be doing too much package building.  \r\n\r\nOh Hell, I donâ€™t write POSTS this long!
