message: "Dave, thanks for your public comment ;-)  \r\n\r\nDont't get me wrong, guys. I don't intend to start a new blog software right now. .Text is an awesome piece of work, and I'm really thankful to ScottW. Like Dave, I love to dive into Scott's code and learn from the architecture.  \r\n\r\nWell, it's just that many of you have made great additions to .Text, and others, who are not developers, want to integrate these into their own setups. It's cool that Don has published his additions as sources, but not everyone is able to integrate them to their server. Just look at Gary's comment above."
