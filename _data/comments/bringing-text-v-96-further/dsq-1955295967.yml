message: "Wow.  \r\n\r\nI had the exact same idea. I just implemented a whole bunch of spam blocking to my site, but all of it was through modules or httphandlers so I wouldn't have to touch the code base. The site works, as-is, but I figured I would go out, get the latest source and start bringing it up to speed.  \r\n\r\nLike you, I really don't think CS will be for me. There is little interest from the other bloggers on my site for the forums and gallery.  \r\n\r\nMy current plan is to add some spam blocking to the.96 codebase and then start to add some of the features that other blogging engines have. (Easy skin creation, geocoding, etc.)  \r\n\r\nIf you are interested in starting up a small, distributed dev team let me know."
