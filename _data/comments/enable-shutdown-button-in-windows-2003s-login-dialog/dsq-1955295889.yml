message: thanks so much for this post! since i use vm's, i always just needed to have my win2k3 server running but didn't actually have to log in to start working. when i would be ready to shut things down, i'd have to go through the process of logging in to the vm just to shut it down. you have increased my productivity by several minutes per day :)
