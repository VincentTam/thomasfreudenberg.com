  Ok, I admit defeat, you got me, I must be as blind as a bat......



  Help.......



  Try as I might I cannot get this working. I am using [Blogengine.net](http://Blogengine.net "Blogengine.net") as the hosting system for my blog, and have successfully published items to it using Windows Live Writer, but when I try to use your publisher, nothing, zip, nardar. And nothing is logged in CCNet. Any information you might be able to provide will be greatfully received.
