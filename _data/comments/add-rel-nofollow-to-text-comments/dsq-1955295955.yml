message: "Great post, Thomas. Excellent description of implementation for 0.96. I was going to ask you for a 0.95 version, but after reading the last line I decided not to. :-)  \r\n\r\nThis is interesting, but I never thought comment URLs were a problem. Maybe I don't yet fully understand the concept. Bogus trackbacks and referrals, yes, but not comments.  \r\n\r\nIf I implement a 0.95 version I'll let you know. Thanks!  "
