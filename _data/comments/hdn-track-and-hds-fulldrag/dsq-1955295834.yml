message: "*** MS Header's HDS_FULLDRAG stopped working in Windows 7 when app doesn't use visual styles ***\r\n\r\nWe are a company that develops and sells shareware ActiveX and .NET controls for other developers (see [www.10Tec.com](http://www.10Tec.com \"www.10Tec.com\")). We are using the native MS Header control in one of our controls, ActiveX grid called iGrid, and we detected that one style of this header control does not work properly in the latest versions of Windows, such as Windows 7.\r\n\r\nWe are talking about the HDS_FULLDRAG style which causes column headers to be redrawn while the user is resizing them. This style works like a charm in Windows XP, but it does not have any effect in Windows 7 if the app does not use visual styles (which are turned on using a special manifest file embedded as a resource). If the app uses visual styles, all works as expected.\r\n\r\nJust one addition for those who know what notification messages are sent by the header control when the user is resizing a column. If HDS_FULLDRAG has effect, HDN_ITEMCHANGING is sent instead of HDN_TRACK. In our case, in Windows 7, HDN_TRACK is sent is both cases â€“ when HDS_FULLDRAG is specified or not.\r\n\r\nHas anybody encountered the same problem or at least can give some ideas of what it could be and how to overcome this?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance,  \r\n10Tec Development team"
