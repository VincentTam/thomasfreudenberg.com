  A lot of folks have been saying things like "what's the big deal about Twitter"...it's ideas like this which will quickly prove the usefulness of a service like Twitter (I've had a couple of ideas, mainly more along the lines of office productivity type stuff), however Twitter itself needs to become more stable before anyone can start staking anything even semi-mission critical in it.



  Well done!
