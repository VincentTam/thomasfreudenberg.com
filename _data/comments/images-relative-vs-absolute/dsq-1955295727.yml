I am asking because I have the same doubt for my site [dotnet.innovactive.it](http://dotnet.innovactive.it \"dotnet.innovactive.it\"), and had to pute the whole absolute link in the images. This is an annoyance since if we move the svr to another domain every link must be revritten.  \r\n\r\nI'd like to know more about your solution.   \r\n\r\nI assure you that on SR your feed shows images, as well as in RSS bandit 1.1.0.36  \r\n\r\nm."
