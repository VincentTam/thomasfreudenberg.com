message: "Hi Dave,\r\n\r\nI didn't need the exclusion of files and folders, so I didn't implement it. Feel free to modify my code, you can find it on [Github](https://github.com/thoemmi/7Zip4Powershell \"https://github.com/thoemmi/7Zip4Powershell\"). How about using the pipeline featire of PowerShell? I would accept a pull request.\r\n\r\nBest regards  \r\nThomas"
