message: "Hi Thomas,\r\n\r\nThanks for great work. I have downloaded the package and started using. It's really great.  \r\nCan you please help me how can I modify your package ?  \r\nActually I want to exclude few folders and file extensions, but filter parameter just include those files/folder which are filtered.  \r\nMay be your work required that, but is there any existing setting to exclude folders and files?\r\n\r\nThanks,  \r\nDave"
