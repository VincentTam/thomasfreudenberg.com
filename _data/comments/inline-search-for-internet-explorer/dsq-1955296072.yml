  This really is a great feature! If Microsoft keeps this up then within only another year or two it will be able to do what Firefox has been doing for years.



  If you haven't already been working with it, def. check out using Firefox for development. The plugins are amazing. View source has syntax coloring. It has plugins for javascript debugging in the browser, editing style sheets of open pages within the browser to see the impact, color pickers to sample colors from graphics and put it in the clipboard as a color code, plugins to drag your mouse to measure screen elements in pixels, 1-click buttons to sample colors of a screen element and export a photoshop color palette, it goes on and on and on.
