  Thanks - that was great help.



  Not being a MSBuild guru I just (proudly) managed to integrate several c# based projects in a single file assembly - after modifying parts of the central build and .csproj xmls to ensure I would actually get netmodules from VS2005.



  I am still struggling to remove the external references from the assembly which I need for the VS IDE - not sure it matters, maybe for purity only. The code works as csc when adding netmodules that implement the same types as ref'd projects/dlls apparently overwrites the external reference - at least it issues a warning.



  I would hope sometime this to be supported by VS.



  Again - thanks for posting this!
