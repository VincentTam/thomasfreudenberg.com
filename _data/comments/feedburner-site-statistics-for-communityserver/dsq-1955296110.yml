message: Thomas, This looks very promising, but I'm not sure what it does. I'm not a Feedburner or Blogbeat user. You're saying that you can get site page load and visitor traffic reports adding your code similar to Google Analytics. Or in other words, you need to apply this mod to get the four benefits of Feedburner Nick listed in your excerpt? Sorry to be so dense. :-)
